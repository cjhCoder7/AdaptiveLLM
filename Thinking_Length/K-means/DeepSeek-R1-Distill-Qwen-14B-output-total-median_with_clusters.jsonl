You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nYou are given an integer array a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j.

Note that you can exit the grid from any leftmost empty cell (cell in the first column) by going left, and from any topmost empty cell (cell in the first row) by going up.\n\nLet's call a grid determinable if, given only which cells are exitable, we can exactly determine which cells are filled in and which aren't.\n\nYou are given a grid a of dimensions n \u00d7 m , i. e. a grid with n rows and m columns. You need to answer q queries (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5). Each query gives two integers x_1, x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m) and asks whether the subgrid of a consisting of the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6, nm \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the dimensions of the grid a.\n\nn lines follow. The y-th line contains m characters, the x-th of which is 'X' if the cell on the intersection of the the y-th row and x-th column is filled and \".\" if it is empty.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nq lines follow. Each line contains two integers x_1 and x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m), representing a query asking whether the subgrid of a containing the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output one line containing \"YES\" if the subgrid specified by the query is determinable and \"NO\" otherwise. The output is case insensitive (so \"yEs\" and \"No\" will also be accepted).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4 5\n..XXX\n...X.\n...X.\n...X.\n5\n1 3\n3 3\n4 5\n5 5\n1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nFor each query of the example, the corresponding subgrid is displayed twice below: first in its input format, then with each cell marked as \"E\" if it is exitable and \"N\" otherwise.\n\nFor the first query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..X EEN  \n    ... EEE  \n    ... EEE  \n    ... EEE  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the second query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    \n\nNote that you can exit the grid by going left from any leftmost cell (or up from any topmost cell); you do not need to reach the top left corner cell to exit the grid.\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the third query: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    \n\nThis subgrid cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable, because the below grid produces the above \"exitability grid\" as well: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fourth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fifth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..XXX EENNN  \n    ...X. EEENN  \n    ...X. EEENN  \n    ...X. EEENN  \n    \n\nThis query is simply the entire grid. It cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable because the below grid produces the above \"exitability grid\" as well: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..XXX  \n    ...XX  \n    ...XX  \n    ...XX  \n    \n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries.\n\nA query consists of an array a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n of integers between 1 and n. a is not required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of a and p, meaning that he will compute an array s where s_j = p_j + a_j for all j = 1, 2, \u2026, n. Then, he will find the smallest index k such that s_k occurs more than once in s, and answer with k. If there is no such index k, then he will answer with 0.\n\nYou can perform at most 2n queries.

This yields s = [3 + 3, 2 + 5, 1 + 1, 5 + 5, 4 + 5] = [6, 7, 2, 10, 9]. There are no numbers that appear more than once here, so the answer to the query is 0.\n\nThe third query is a = [5, 2, 4, 3, 1].

The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a\u2212p|+|b\u2212q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy.

Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, c_d, and p (4 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^5, n, m \u2265 2, 1 \u2264 r_b, r_d \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_b, c_d \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 99) \u2014 the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot, the position of the dirt cell and the probability of cleaning in percentage.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the expected time for the robot to clean the dirty cell, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2 2 1 1 2 1 25\n3 3 1 2 2 2 25\n10 10 1 1 10 10 75\n10 10 10 10 1 1 75\n5 5 1 3 2 2 10\n97 98 3 5 41 43 50\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n3\n15\n15\n332103349\n99224487\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the robot has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second. Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same. The only difference is that the position of the dirty cell and the robot are swapped. But the movements in both cases are identical, hence the same result.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Each node can have no child, only one left child, only one right child, or both children. For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child.\n\nEach node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k. What is the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree, if we can duplicate labels of at most k nodes?\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: \n\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a \u2260 b; \n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains a string c of n lower-case English letters, where c_i is the initial label of the node i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Note that the given string c is not the initial string representation of the tree.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (0 \u2264 l_i, r_i \u2264 n).

The number in each node is the node number, while the subscripted letter is its label. To the right is the string representation of the tree, with each letter having the same color as the corresponding node.\n\nHere is the tree for the first example. Here we duplicated the labels of nodes 1 and 3. We should not duplicate the label of node 2 because it would give us the string \"bbaaab\", which is lexicographically greater than \"baaaab\".\n\n<image>\n\nIn the second example, we can duplicate the labels of nodes 1 and 2. Note that only duplicating the label of the root will produce a worse result than the initial string.\n\n<image>\n\nIn the third example, we should not duplicate any character at all.

The array `sick` contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position `i` can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions `i - 1` and `i + 1` **if** they exist and are currently not infected. **At most one** child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\n\n\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease.

{"id": "LeetCode/212", "prompt": "# Minimum Reverse Operations\n\nYou are given an integer `n` and an integer `p` in the range `[0, n - 1]`. Representing a **0-indexed** array `arr`\u00a0of length `n` where all positions are set to `0`'s, except position `p` which is set to `1`.\n\n\nYou are also given an integer array `banned` containing some positions from the array. For the **i****th** position in `banned`, `arr[banned[i]] = 0`, and `banned[i] != p`.\n\n\nYou can perform **multiple** operations on `arr`. In an operation, you can choose a **subarray** with size `k` and **reverse** the subarray. However, the `1` in `arr` should never go to any of the positions in `banned`. In other words, after each operation `arr[banned[i]]` **remains** `0`.\n\n\n*Return an array* `ans` *where* *for each* `i` *from* `[0, n - 1]`, `ans[i]` *is the **minimum** number of reverse operations needed to bring the* `1` *to position* `i` *in arr*, *or* `-1` *if it is impossible*.\n\n\n* A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.\n* The values of `ans[i]` are independent for all `i`'s.\n* The **reverse** of an array is an array containing the values in **reverse order**.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** n = 4, p = 0, banned = [1,2], k = 4\n**Output:** [0,-1,-1,1]\n**Explanation:** In this case k = 4 so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is 0. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1. Finally, with one reverse operation we can bring the 1 to index 3, so the answer for position 3 is 1. \n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** n = 5, p = 0, banned = [2,4], k = 3\n**Output:** [0,-1,-1,-1,-1]\n**Explanation:** In this case the 1 is initially at position 0, so the answer for that position is 0. We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray [0, 2] for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions -1. \n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** n = 4, p = 2, banned = [0,1,3], k = 1\n**Output:** [-1,-1,0,-1]\n**Explanation:** In this case we can only perform reverse operations of size 1.So the 1 never changes its position.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= n <= 105`\n* `0 <= p <= n - 1`\n* `0 <= banned.length <= n - 1`\n* `0 <= banned[i] <= n - 1`\n* `1 <= k <= n`\n* `banned[i] != p`\n* all values in `banned`\u00a0are **unique**\n\n\n\n\nPlease make sure your answer follows the type signature below:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minReverseOperations(self, n: int, p: int, banned: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n```\n", "acRate": "21.4%", "questionId": "2726", "think_lengths": [42853, 41060, 47263, 41290, 46826, 46497, 45256, 35154, 44101, 38829], "thinking_time": [106.0, 180.0, 157.0, 120.0, 154.0], "average_thinking_time": 143.66666666666666, "median": 43477.0, "cluster": 2}
