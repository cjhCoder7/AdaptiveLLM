Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8].

If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length d. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways.\n\nBecause of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal.

Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines.

The world you live in is a giant 10^9 \u00d7 10^9 grid, with squares having both coordinates between 1 and 10^9. \n\nYou know that the enemy base has the shape of a rectangle, with the sides parallel to the sides of the grid. The people of your world are extremely scared of being at the edge of the world, so you know that the base doesn't contain any of the squares on the edges of the grid (the x or y coordinate being 1 or 10^9). \n\nTo help you locate the base, you have been given a device that you can place in any square of the grid, and it will tell you the manhattan distance to the closest square of the base. The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a\u2212p|+|b\u2212q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy. Because of this, you need to make sure to never place the device inside the enemy base. \n\nUnfortunately, the device is powered by a battery and you can't recharge it. This means that you can use the device at most 40 times. \n\nInput\n\nThe input contains the answers to your queries. \n\nInteraction\n\nYour code is allowed to place the device on any square in the grid by writing \"? i j\" (1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 10^9). In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square (i,j) or -1 if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid. \n\nIf you recieve -1 instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than 40 queries. \n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \"! x y p q\" (1 \u2264 x \u2264 p\u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 q\u2264 10^9), where (x, y) is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest x and y coordinates, and (p, q) is the square inside the enemy base with the largest x and y coordinates. Note that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: \n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * See the documentation for other languages.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n? 2 2\n? 5 5\n? 4 7\n? 1 5\n! 2 3 4 5\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Consider a corner cell. Given any direction, it will move to a neighbouring border grid that's not a corner. Now consider a non-corner free cell. No matter what direction you send to the robot, it can choose a different direction such that it ends up in a corner.\n\nIn the last testcase, you can keep sending the command that is opposite to the direction to the lab and the robot will have no choice other than move towards the lab.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not \u2261 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x \u22c5 y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 \u2264 a < 10^9 + 7 and a \u22c5 y \u2261 x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10).

Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same. The only difference is that the position of the dirty cell and the robot are swapped. But the movements in both cases are identical, hence the same result.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to n and the root is the node 1. Each node can have no child, only one left child, only one right child, or both children. For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child.\n\nEach node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k. What is the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree, if we can duplicate labels of at most k nodes?\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: \n\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a \u2260 b; \n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains a string c of n lower-case English letters, where c_i is the initial label of the node i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.

Here we duplicated the labels of nodes 1 and 3. We should not duplicate the label of node 2 because it would give us the string \"bbaaab\", which is lexicographically greater than \"baaaab\".\n\n<image>\n\nIn the second example, we can duplicate the labels of nodes 1 and 2.
