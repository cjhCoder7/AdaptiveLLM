If the j-th friend (1 \u2264 j \u2264 n) receives a gift bought in the shop with the number i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m), then the friend receives p_{ij} units of joy. The rectangular table p_{ij} is given in the input.\n\nVlad has time to visit at most n-1 shops (where n is the number of friends). He chooses which shops he will visit and for which friends he will buy gifts in each of them.\n\nLet the j-th friend receive a_j units of joy from Vlad's gift. Let's find the value \u03b1=min\\\\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\}. Vlad's goal is to buy gifts so that the value of \u03b1 is as large as possible. In other words, Vlad wants to maximize the minimum of the joys of his friends.\n\nFor example, let m = 2, n = 2. Let the joy from the gifts that we can buy in the first shop: p_{11} = 1, p_{12}=2, in the second shop: p_{21} = 3, p_{22}=4.\n\nThen it is enough for Vlad to go only to the second shop and buy a gift for the first friend, bringing joy 3, and for the second \u2014 bringing joy 4. In this case, the value \u03b1 will be equal to min\\{3, 4\\} = 3\n\nHelp Vlad choose gifts for his friends so that the value of \u03b1 is as high as possible. Please note that each friend must receive one gift. Vlad can visit at most n-1 shops (where n is the number of friends).

The number in the i-th row of the j-th column p_{ij} (1 \u2264 p_{ij} \u2264 10^9) is the joy of the product intended for friend number j in shop number i.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values n \u22c5 m over all test cases in the test does not exceed 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line must contain the answer to the corresponding test case \u2014 the maximum possible value of \u03b1, where \u03b1 is the minimum of the joys from a gift for all of Vlad's friends.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n\n2 2\n1 2\n3 4\n\n4 3\n1 3 1\n3 1 1\n1 2 2\n1 1 3\n\n2 3\n5 3 4\n2 5 1\n\n4 2\n7 9\n8 1\n9 6\n10 8\n\n2 4\n6 5 2 1\n7 9 7 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n2\n4\n8\n2\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/160", "prompt": "# Robot Cleaner\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position.
