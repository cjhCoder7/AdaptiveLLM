Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment.

Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

{"id": "code_contests/15", "prompt": "# Ticks\n\nCasimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n \u00d7 m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.\n\nLet us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).\n\nCasimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: \n\n  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. \n  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. \n  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j \u00b1 h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. \n\n\n\nAn already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 \u00d7 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.\n\n<image>\n\nYou are given a description of a checkered field of size n \u00d7 m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d \u2265 k for all the ticks).\n\nDetermine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d \u2265 k or not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number test cases.\n\nThe following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 19) \u2014 the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2 3 1\n*.*\n...\n4 9 2\n*.*.*...*\n.*.*...*.\n..*.*.*..\n.....*...\n4 4 1\n*.*.\n****\n.**.\n....\n5 5 1\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n5 5 2\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n4 7 1\n*.....*\n.....*.\n..*.*..\n...*...\n3 3 1\n***\n***\n***\n3 5 1\n*...*\n.***.\n.**..\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.\n\nThe second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \\color{blue}{blue}, \\color{red}{red} and \\color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  \n---  \n*\\color{blue}{*}**  \n.\\color{green}{*}\\color{red}{*}.  \n....  \n  \nThe field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \\color{blue}{blue} and \\color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  \n---  \n*...*  \n.*.*.  \n..\\color{red}{*}.*  \n...\\color{blue}{*}.  \n  \nThe field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.\n\nThe field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).\n\nIn the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/17", "prompt": "# Array Optimization by Deque\n\nIn fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nYou are given an integer array a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j. For example, the array d = [5, 3, 7, 5] has exactly two inversions \u2014 (1, 2) and (3, 4), since d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2 and d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 array size. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after executing the described algorithm.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n4\n3 7 5 5\n3\n3 2 1\n3\n3 1 2\n4\n-1 2 2 -1\n4\n4 5 1 3\n5\n1 3 1 3 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n0\n1\n0\n1\n2\n\nNote\n\nOne of the ways to get the sequence [5, 3, 7, 5] in the deque, containing only two inversions, from the initial array [3, 7, 5, 5] (the first sample test case) is described in the problem statement. \n\nAlso, in this example, you could get the answer of two inversions by simply putting each element of the original array at the end of the deque. In this case, the original sequence [3, 7, 5, 5], also containing exactly two inversions, will be in the deque as-is.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Note that in this problem, unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2.

The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time.

Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].

For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\n\nA sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers n, m, k, p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the number of permutations modulo p.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n4 3 2 10007\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n4\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6 4 1 769626776\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n472\n\n\nInput\n\n\n66 11 9 786747482\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n206331312\n\n\nInput\n\n\n99 30 18 650457567\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n77365367\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, there are four permutations: [1, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 1, 4], [4, 1, 3, 2] and [4, 2, 3, 1].\n\nTake permutation [1, 3, 2, 4] as an example:\n\nFor number 1, all subsegments containing it are: [1], [1, 3], [1, 3, 2] and [1, 3, 2, 4], and there're three different maxima 1, 3 and 4.\n\nSimilarly, for number 3, there're two different maxima 3 and 4.

Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length d. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways.\n\nBecause of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station.\n\nDue to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th event will add additional amount of x_i to the cost of building a new railway from the station k_i.\n\nTo save resources, before all incidents and after each incident, Nitori wants you to help her calculate the minimal cost of railway construction.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 q \u2264 2\u22c510^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers w_1,w_2,\u2026,w_n (1 \u2264 w_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, d (1 \u2264 u,v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^9), denoting a two-way railway connecting station u and station v, with length d.\n\nThe i-th of the next q lines contains two integers k_i,x_i (1 \u2264 k_i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 x_i \u2264 4 \u00d7 10^8).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q+1 lines, and the i-th of these lines contains one integer, denoting the minimal cost of railway construction after the i-1-th incident (especially, the 0-th incident means no incident occurred).\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 4 1\n3 5 1\n4 5 1\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n9\n\n\nInput\n\n\n8 11 0\n14 4 16 15 1 3 1 14\n4 2 1\n1 2 3\n7 5 4\n2 3 1\n8 6 2\n8 5 5\n5 4 5\n7 6 7\n3 5 5\n1 6 6\n8 1 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n46\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10 16 8\n29 1 75 73 51 69 24 17 1 97\n1 2 18\n2 3 254\n2 4 546\n2 5 789\n5 6 998\n6 7 233\n7 8 433\n1 9 248\n5 10 488\n2 6 1787\n10 8 1176\n3 8 2199\n4 8 1907\n2 10 1277\n4 10 731\n9 10 1047\n1 11\n1 9\n8 8\n1 3\n2 19\n9 5\n9 4\n7 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n34\n45\n54\n54\n57\n76\n96\n112\n112\n\nNote\n\nIn the second example, Nitori can build railways as follows: 1 \u2192 2, 1 \u2192 3, 1 \u2192 4, 2 \u2192 8, and the cost is 14 + 14 + 14 + 4 = 46.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/38", "prompt": "# Omkar and Determination\n\nThe problem statement looms below, filling you with determination.\n\nConsider a grid in which some cells are empty and some cells are filled. Call a cell in this grid exitable if, starting at that cell, you can exit the grid by moving up and left through only empty cells. This includes the cell itself, so all filled in cells are not exitable. Note that you can exit the grid from any leftmost empty cell (cell in the first column) by going left, and from any topmost empty cell (cell in the first row) by going up.\n\nLet's call a grid determinable if, given only which cells are exitable, we can exactly determine which cells are filled in and which aren't.\n\nYou are given a grid a of dimensions n \u00d7 m , i. e. a grid with n rows and m columns. You need to answer q queries (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5). Each query gives two integers x_1, x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m) and asks whether the subgrid of a consisting of the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6, nm \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the dimensions of the grid a.\n\nn lines follow. The y-th line contains m characters, the x-th of which is 'X' if the cell on the intersection of the the y-th row and x-th column is filled and \".\" if it is empty.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nq lines follow. Each line contains two integers x_1 and x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m), representing a query asking whether the subgrid of a containing the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output one line containing \"YES\" if the subgrid specified by the query is determinable and \"NO\" otherwise. The output is case insensitive (so \"yEs\" and \"No\" will also be accepted).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4 5\n..XXX\n...X.\n...X.\n...X.\n5\n1 3\n3 3\n4 5\n5 5\n1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nFor each query of the example, the corresponding subgrid is displayed twice below: first in its input format, then with each cell marked as \"E\" if it is exitable and \"N\" otherwise.\n\nFor the first query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..X EEN  \n    ... EEE  \n    ... EEE  \n    ... EEE  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the second query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    \n\nNote that you can exit the grid by going left from any leftmost cell (or up from any topmost cell); you do not need to reach the top left corner cell to exit the grid.\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the third query: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    \n\nThis subgrid cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable, because the below grid produces the above \"exitability grid\" as well: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fourth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fifth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..XXX EENNN  \n    ...X. EEENN  \n    ...X. EEENN  \n    ...X.

Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries.\n\nA query consists of an array a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n of integers between 1 and n. a is not required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of a and p, meaning that he will compute an array s where s_j = p_j + a_j for all j = 1, 2, \u2026, n. Then, he will find the smallest index k such that s_k occurs more than once in s, and answer with k. If there is no such index k, then he will answer with 0.\n\nYou can perform at most 2n queries. Figure out the meaning of life p.\n\nInteraction\n\nStart the interaction by reading single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the permutation p.\n\nYou can then make queries. A query consists of a single line \"? \\enspace a_1 \\enspace a_2 \\enspace \u2026 \\enspace a_n\" (1 \u2264 a_j \u2264 n).\n\nThe answer to each query will be a single integer k as described above (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n).\n\nAfter making a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n  * System.out.flush() in Java;\n  * flush(output) in Pascal;\n  * stdout.flush() in Python;\n  * see documentation for other languages.\n\n\n\nTo output your answer, print a single line \"! \\enspace p_1 \\enspace p_2 \\enspace \u2026 \\enspace p_n\" then terminate.\n\nYou can make at most 2n queries. Outputting the answer does not count as a query.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, first output a line containing n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100), then output another line containing the hidden permutation p_1, p_2, \u2026, p_n of numbers from 1 to n.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n? 4 4 2 3 2\n\n? 3 5 1 5 5\n\n? 5 2 4 3 1\n\n! 3 2 1 5 4\n\nNote\n\nIn the sample, the hidden permutation p is [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]. Three queries were made.\n\nThe first query is a = [4, 4, 2, 3, 2]. This yields s = [3 + 4, 2 + 4, 1 + 2, 5 + 3, 4 + 2] = [7, 6, 3, 8, 6]. 6 is the only number that appears more than once, and it appears first at index 2, making the answer to the query 2.\n\nThe second query is a = [3, 5, 1, 5, 5]. This yields s = [3 + 3, 2 + 5, 1 + 1, 5 + 5, 4 + 5] = [6, 7, 2, 10, 9].

All 2n of these times are distinct (so every time from 1 to 2n inclusive appears exactly once in the input).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 n) \u2014 the size of the set s of tasks that lead to the funny scene.\n\nThe last line contains t integers s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_t \u2014 (1 \u2264 s_k \u2264 n, the numbers s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_t are distinct) \u2014 the set s of tasks.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the number of times that Okabe time travels until all tasks in the set s are simultaneously completed, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n2\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1 2\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n10 12\n3 7\n4 6\n2 9\n5 8\n1 11\n3\n2 4 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n17\n\n\nInput\n\n\n16\n31 32\n3 26\n17 19\n4 24\n1 28\n15 21\n12 16\n18 29\n20 23\n7 8\n11 14\n9 22\n6 30\n5 10\n25 27\n2 13\n6\n3 8 2 5 12 11\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n138\n\nNote\n\nFor the first sample, all tasks need to be completed in order for the funny scene to occur.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Nothing happens until time 3, when Okabe realizes that he should have done the 2-nd task at time 2. He then time travels to time 2 and completes the task.\n\nAs the task is done now, he does not time travel again when the time is again 3. However, at time 4, he travels to time 1 to complete the 1-st task.\n\nThis undoes the 2-nd task. This means that the 2-nd task is not currently completed, meaning that the funny scene will not occur at this point even though the 1-st task is currently completed and Okabe had previously completed the 2-nd task.\n\nOnce it is again time 3 he travels back to time 2 once more and does the 2-nd task again.\n\nNow all tasks are complete, with Okabe having time travelled 3 times.\n\nThe second sample has the same tasks for Okabe to complete. However, this time the funny scene only needs the first task to be completed in order to occur. From reading the above sample you can see that this occurs once Okabe has time travelled 2 times.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/43", "prompt": "# Omkar and Tours\n\nOmkar is hosting tours of his country, Omkarland! There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines. The i-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the i-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the i-th tour group.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n1 2 4 7\n1 3 2 8\n2 4 8 2\n2 5 1 1\n1 3\n9 5\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 8\n3 0\n3 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 4 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 2 1\n2 5 1 1\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 8\n1 3 6 3\n1 4 4 5\n1 5 7 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 8\n2 8\n2 3\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNote\n\nA map of the first sample is shown below. For the nodes, unbolded numbers represent indices and bolded numbers represent enjoyment values. For the edges, unbolded numbers represent capacities and bolded numbers represent tolls.\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 3 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

When the mosaic is complete, each cell in the grid will have either a glaucous or sinoper tile. However, currently he has only placed tiles in some cells. \n\nA completed mosaic will be a mastapeece if and only if each tile is adjacent to exactly 2 tiles of the same color (2 tiles are adjacent if they share a side.) Omkar wants to fill the rest of the tiles so that the mosaic becomes a mastapeece.

{"id": "code_contests/49", "prompt": "# Frequency Queries\n\nPetya has a rooted tree with an integer written on each vertex. The vertex 1 is the root. You are to answer some questions about the tree.\n\nA tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a node v is the next vertex on the shortest path from v to the root.\n\nEach question is defined by three integers v, l, and k. To get the answer to the question, you need to perform the following steps: \n\n  * First, write down the sequence of all integers written on the shortest path from the vertex v to the root (including those written in the v and the root). \n  * Count the number of times each integer occurs. Remove all integers with less than l occurrences. \n  * Replace the sequence, removing all duplicates and ordering the elements by the number of occurrences in the original list in increasing order. In case of a tie, you can choose the order of these elements arbitrary. \n  * The answer to the question is the k-th number in the remaining sequence. Note that the answer is not always uniquely determined, because there could be several orderings. Also, it is possible that the length of the sequence on this step is less than k, in this case the answer is -1. \n\n\n\nFor example, if the sequence of integers on the path from v to the root is [2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], l = 2 and k = 2, then the answer is 1.\n\nPlease answer all questions about the tree.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^6). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n, q (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the number of questions.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 n), where a_i is the number written on the i-th vertex.\n\nThe third line contains n-1 integers p_2, p_3, \u2026, p_n (1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n), where p_i is the parent of node i. It's guaranteed that the values p define a correct tree.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains three integers v, l, k (1 \u2264 v, l, k \u2264 n) \u2014 descriptions of questions.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each question of each test case print the answer to the question.

Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/72", "prompt": "# Hidden Fortress\n\nThis is an interactive problem!\n\nAs part of your contribution in the Great Bubble War, you have been tasked with finding the newly built enemy fortress. The world you live in is a giant 10^9 \u00d7 10^9 grid, with squares having both coordinates between 1 and 10^9. \n\nYou know that the enemy base has the shape of a rectangle, with the sides parallel to the sides of the grid. The people of your world are extremely scared of being at the edge of the world, so you know that the base doesn't contain any of the squares on the edges of the grid (the x or y coordinate being 1 or 10^9). \n\nTo help you locate the base, you have been given a device that you can place in any square of the grid, and it will tell you the manhattan distance to the closest square of the base. The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a\u2212p|+|b\u2212q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy. Because of this, you need to make sure to never place the device inside the enemy base. \n\nUnfortunately, the device is powered by a battery and you can't recharge it. This means that you can use the device at most 40 times. \n\nInput\n\nThe input contains the answers to your queries. \n\nInteraction\n\nYour code is allowed to place the device on any square in the grid by writing \"? i j\" (1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 10^9). In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square (i,j) or -1 if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid. \n\nIf you recieve -1 instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than 40 queries. \n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \"! x y p q\" (1 \u2264 x \u2264 p\u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 q\u2264 10^9), where (x, y) is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest x and y coordinates, and (p, q) is the square inside the enemy base with the largest x and y coordinates. Note that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: \n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * See the documentation for other languages.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n? 2 2\n? 5 5\n? 4 7\n? 1 5\n! 2 3 4 5\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

That's why for his birthday, his friends bought him a really interesting machine \u2013 an array beautifier. \n\nThe array beautifier takes an array A consisting of N integers, and it outputs a new array B of length N that it constructed based on the array given to it. The array beautifier constructs the new array in the following way: it takes two numbers at different indices from the original array and writes their sum to the end of the new array. It does this step N times - resulting in an output array of length N. During this process, the machine can take the same index multiple times in different steps. \n\nBob was very excited about the gift that his friends gave him, so he put his favorite array in the machine. However, when the machine finished, Bob was not happy with the resulting array. He misses his favorite array very much, and hopes to get it back. \n\nGiven the array that the machine outputted, help Bob find an array that could be the original array that he put in the machine. Sometimes the machine makes mistakes, so it is possible that no appropriate input array exists for the array it has outputted. In such case, let Bob know that his array is forever lost.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one positive integer N (2 \u2264 N \u2264 10^3) \u2013 the length of Bob's array.\n\nThe second line contains N integers B_1, B_2, ..., B_N (1 \u2264 B_i \u2264 10^6) \u2013 the elements of the array the machine outputted.\n\nOutput\n\nIf an appropriate input array exists, print \"YES\", followed by the input array A_1, A_2, ..., A_N (-10^9 \u2264 A_i \u2264 10^9) in the next line.

Now Gorf is on the bottom of the well and has a long way up.\n\nThe surface of the well's walls vary in quality: somewhere they are slippery, but somewhere have convenient ledges. In other words, if Gorf is on x meters below ground level, then in one jump he can go up on any integer distance from 0 to a_x meters inclusive. (Note that Gorf can't jump down, only up).\n\nUnfortunately, Gorf has to take a break after each jump (including jump on 0 meters). And after jumping up to position x meters below ground level, he'll slip exactly b_x meters down while resting.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of jumps Gorf needs to reach ground level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300 000) \u2014 the depth of the well.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 i), where a_i is the maximum height Gorf can jump from i meters below ground level.\n\nThe third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_n (0 \u2264 b_i \u2264 n - i), where b_i is the distance Gorf will slip down if he takes a break on i meters below ground level.\n\nOutput\n\nIf Gorf can't reach ground level, print -1. Otherwise, firstly print integer k \u2014 the minimum possible number of jumps.\n\nThen print the sequence d_1,\\,d_2, \u2026,\\,d_k where d_j is the depth Gorf'll reach after the j-th jump, but before he'll slip down during the break.

After that he slip down by meter and stays on height 2 meters below ground level. Now, from here, he can reach ground level in one jump.\n\nIn the second example, Gorf can jump to one meter below ground level, but will slip down back to the bottom of the well. That's why he can't reach ground level.\n\nIn the third example, Gorf can reach ground level only from the height 5 meters below the ground level. And Gorf can reach this height using a series of jumps 10 \u21d2 9 \\dashrightarrow 9 \u21d2 4 \\dashrightarrow 5 where \u21d2 is the jump and \\dashrightarrow is slipping during breaks.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/115", "prompt": "# Poisoned Dagger\n\nMonocarp is playing yet another computer game. In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage.\n\nMonocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle \u2014 he slays the dragon.

{"id": "code_contests/117", "prompt": "# Crazy Robot\n\nThere is a grid, consisting of n rows and m columns. Each cell of the grid is either free or blocked. One of the free cells contains a lab. All the cells beyond the borders of the grid are also blocked.\n\nA crazy robot has escaped from this lab. It is currently in some free cell of the grid. You can send one of the following commands to the robot: \"move right\", \"move down\", \"move left\" or \"move up\". Each command means moving to a neighbouring cell in the corresponding direction.\n\nHowever, as the robot is crazy, it will do anything except following the command. Upon receiving a command, it will choose a direction such that it differs from the one in command and the cell in that direction is not blocked. If there is such a direction, then it will move to a neighbouring cell in that direction. Otherwise, it will do nothing.\n\nWe want to get the robot to the lab to get it fixed. For each free cell, determine if the robot can be forced to reach the lab starting in this cell. That is, after each step of the robot a command can be sent to a robot such that no matter what different directions the robot chooses, it will end up in a lab.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6; n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines provides a description of the i-th row of the grid. It consists of m elements of one of three types: \n\n  * '.' \u2014 the cell is free; \n  * '#' \u2014 the cell is blocked; \n  * 'L' \u2014 the cell contains a lab. \n\n\n\nThe grid contains exactly one lab. The sum of n \u22c5 m over all testcases doesn't exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase find the free cells that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. Given the grid, replace the free cells (marked with a dot) with a plus sign ('+') for the cells that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from.

Consider a corner cell. Given any direction, it will move to a neighbouring border grid that's not a corner. Now consider a non-corner free cell. No matter what direction you send to the robot, it can choose a different direction such that it ends up in a corner.\n\nIn the last testcase, you can keep sending the command that is opposite to the direction to the lab and the robot will have no choice other than move towards the lab.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/122", "prompt": "# X(or)-mas Tree\n\n'Twas the night before Christmas, and Santa's frantically setting up his new Christmas tree! There are n nodes in the tree, connected by n-1 edges. On each edge of the tree, there's a set of Christmas lights, which can be represented by an integer in binary representation.\n\n<image>\n\nHe has m elves come over and admire his tree. Each elf is assigned two nodes, a and b, and that elf looks at all lights on the simple path between the two nodes. After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the values of the lights on the edges in that path.\n\nHowever, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned (a_i, b_i), as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of 1's when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even.\n\nHelp Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the size of tree and the number of elves respectively.\n\nThe next n-1 lines of each test case each contains three integers, x, y, and v (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; -1 \u2264 v < 2^{30}) \u2014 meaning that there's an edge between nodes x and y. If \n\n  * v = -1: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. \n  * v \u2265 0: The set of lights on the edge is v. \n\n\n\nThe next m lines of each test case each contains three integers, a, b, and p (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n; a \u2260 b; 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1) \u2014 the nodes that the elf was assigned to, and the parity of the number of set bits in the elf's favorite number.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n and the sum of all m don't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 each.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first print either YES or NO (in any case), whether there's a tree consistent with Santa's memory or not. \n\nIf the answer is YES, print n-1 lines each containing three integers: x, y, and v (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; 0 \u2264 v < 2^{30}) \u2014 the edge and the integer on that edge. The set of edges must be the same as in the input, and if the value of some edge was specified earlier, it can not change. You can print the edges in any order.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n6 5\n1 2 -1\n1 3 1\n4 2 7\n6 3 0\n2 5 -1\n2 3 1\n2 5 0\n5 6 1\n6 1 1\n4 5 1\n5 3\n1 2 -1\n1 3 -1\n1 4 1\n4 5 -1\n2 4 0\n3 4 1\n2 3 1\n3 3\n1 2 -1\n1 3 -1\n1 2 0\n1 3 1\n2 3 0\n2 1\n1 2 1\n1 2 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\n1 2 0\n1 3 1\n2 4 7\n3 6 0\n2 5 0\nYES\n1 2 1\n1 3 0\n1 4 1\n4 5 1\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first test case is the image in the statement.\n\nOne possible answer is assigning the value of the edge (1, 2) to 5, and the value of the edge (2, 5) to 3. This is correct because: \n\n  * The first elf goes from node 2 to node 3. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the value 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The second elf goes from node 2 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 3, so he remembers the value 0 (as 3 has an even number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The third elf goes from node 5 to node 6. This elf's favorite number is 7, so he remembers the value 1 (as 7 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fourth elf goes from node 6 to node 1. This elf's favorite number is 1, so he remembers the value 1 (as 1 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fifth elf goes from node 4 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the number 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n\n\n\nNote that there are other possible answers.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

The mischievous duo is now vandalizing a rooted tree, by coloring the nodes while playing their favorite game.\n\nThe game works as follows: there is a tree of size n, rooted at node 1, where each node is initially white. Red and Blue get one turn each. Red goes first. \n\nIn Red's turn, he can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree red. \n\nHowever, to make the game fair, Red is only allowed to color k nodes of the tree. In other words, after Red's turn, at most k of the nodes can be colored red.\n\nThen, it's Blue's turn. Blue can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree blue. However, he's not allowed to choose a subtree that contains a node already colored red, as that would make the node purple and no one likes purple crayon. \n\nNote: there's no restriction on the number of nodes Blue can color, as long as he doesn't color a node that Red has already colored.\n\nAfter the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let w be the number of white nodes, r be the number of red nodes, and b be the number of blue nodes. The score of the game is w \u22c5 (r - b).\n\nRed wants to maximize this score, and Blue wants to minimize it.

{"id": "code_contests/124", "prompt": "# LEGOndary Grandmaster\n\nAfter getting bored by playing with crayons, you decided to switch to Legos! Today, you're working with a long strip, with height 1 and length n, some positions of which are occupied by 1 by 1 Lego pieces.\n\nIn one second, you can either remove two adjacent Lego pieces from the strip (if both are present), or add two Lego pieces to adjacent positions (if both are absent). You can only add or remove Lego's at two adjacent positions at the same time, as otherwise your chubby fingers run into precision issues.\n\nYou want to know exactly how much time you'll spend playing with Legos. You value efficiency, so given some starting state and some ending state, you'll always spend the least number of seconds to transform the starting state into the ending state. If it's impossible to transform the starting state into the ending state, you just skip it (so you spend 0 seconds).\n\nThe issue is that, for some positions, you don't remember whether there were Legos there or not (in either the starting state, the ending state, or both). Over all pairs of (starting state, ending state) that are consistent with your memory, find the total amount of time it will take to transform the starting state to the ending state. Print this value modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7). \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the size of the Lego strip.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string s of length n, consisting of the characters 0, 1, and ? \u2014 your memory of the starting state: \n\n  * 1 represents a position that definitely has a Lego piece, \n  * 0 represents a position that definitely does not have a Lego piece, \n  * and ? represents a position that you don't remember. \n\n\n\nThe third line of each test case contains a string t of length n, consisting of the characters 0, 1, and ? \u2014 your memory of the ending state. It follows a similar format to the starting state.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2000.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7). \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2\n00\n11\n3\n???\n???\n3\n??1\n0?0\n4\n??0?\n??11\n5\n?????\n0??1?\n10\n?01??01?1?\n??100?1???\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n16\n1\n14\n101\n1674\n\nNote\n\nFor the first test case, 00 is the only possible starting state, and 11 is the only possible ending state. It takes exactly one operation to change 00 to 11.\n\nFor the second test case, some of the possible starting and ending state pairs are: \n\n  * (000, 011) \u2014 takes 1 operation. \n  * (001, 100) \u2014 takes 2 operations. \n  * (010, 000) \u2014 takes 0 operations, as it's impossible to achieve the ending state. \n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/145", "prompt": "# Unusual Minesweeper\n\nPolycarp is very fond of playing the game Minesweeper. Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules.\n\nThere are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known (x_i, y_i). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of k (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a \"plus\" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines according to the rules described above.\n\nPolycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nAn empty line is written in front of each test suite.\n\nNext comes a line that contains integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.\n\nThen n lines follow, the i-th of which describes the x and y coordinates of the i-th mine and the time until its explosion (-10^9 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 timer \u2264 10^9). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values n over all test cases in the test does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data \u2014 the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n\n5 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n5 2\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n6 1\n1 -1 3\n0 -1 9\n0 1 7\n-1 0 1\n-1 1 9\n-1 -1 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image> Picture from examples\n\nFirst example: \n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2), it does not detonate any other mine since k=0. \n  * 1 second: we explode the mine at the cell (0, 1), and the mine at the cell (0, 0) explodes itself. \n  * 2 second: we explode the mine at the cell (1, 1), and the mine at the cell (1, 0) explodes itself.\n\n\n\nSecond example:\n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2) we get: \n\n<image>\n\n  * 1 second: the mine at coordinate (0, 0) explodes and since k=2 the explosion detonates mines at the cells (0, 1) and (1, 0), and their explosions detonate the mine at the cell (1, 1) and there are no mines left on the field. \n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirty cell. Each second the robot cleans a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the time for the robot to do its job.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

{"id": "code_contests/163", "prompt": "# Robot Cleaner Revisit\n\nThe statement of this problem shares a lot with problem A. The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not \u2261 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x \u22c5 y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 \u2264 a < 10^9 + 7 and a \u22c5 y \u2261 x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, c_d, and p (4 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^5, n, m \u2265 2, 1 \u2264 r_b, r_d \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_b, c_d \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 99) \u2014 the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot, the position of the dirt cell and the probability of cleaning in percentage.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the expected time for the robot to clean the dirty cell, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2 2 1 1 2 1 25\n3 3 1 2 2 2 25\n10 10 1 1 10 10 75\n10 10 10 10 1 1 75\n5 5 1 3 2 2 10\n97 98 3 5 41 43 50\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n3\n15\n15\n332103349\n99224487\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the robot has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second. Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same. The only difference is that the position of the dirty cell and the robot are swapped. But the movements in both cases are identical, hence the same result.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Each node can have no child, only one left child, only one right child, or both children. For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child.\n\nEach node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k.
