We continue this process until the heap is empty. The length of the heap at the end will be the minimum length of the array after performing the operations.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because we are performing n heap operations each taking log n time. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the numbers in a heap.\n", "This problem can be solved by using a greedy approach. The idea is to always select the two largest numbers in the array and perform the operation on them. This is because the operation `nums[i] % nums[j]` will always be less than or equal to `nums[j]`. By doing this, we can reduce the size of the array by at least one.\n\nHere is a Python solution using a priority queue:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumArrayLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Create a priority queue with the negative values of the numbers\n        pq = [-num for num in nums]\n        heapq.heapify(pq)\n        \n        # While there are more than one number in the queue\n        while len(pq) > 1:\n            # Get the two largest numbers\n            num1 = -heapq.heappop(pq)\n            num2 = -heapq.heappop(pq)\n            \n            # If the two numbers are not equal, insert the result of the operation at the end of the queue\n            if num1 != num2:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, -(num1 % num2))\n        \n        # Return the length of the queue\n        return len(pq)\n```\n\nThis solution works by first creating a priority queue with the negative values of the numbers. Then, it enters a loop where it continuously selects the two largest numbers, performs the operation on them, and inserts the result at the end of the queue. If the two numbers are not equal, it inserts the result at the end of the queue. The loop continues until there is only one number left in the queue. Finally, it returns the length of the queue, which is the minimum length of the array after performing the operations.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array.

Then, while there are more than one number in the heap, it pops off the two largest numbers, performs the operation, and pushes the result back onto the heap. If the two numbers are equal, it doesn't push anything back onto the heap. Finally, it returns the length of the heap, which is the minimum length of the array.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n log n) because each heap operation takes O(log n) time, and there are O(n) heap operations.

We continue this process until we find a number whose price is less than or equal to `k`.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def findMaximumNumber(self, k: int, x: int) -> int:\n        def count_set_bits(n):\n            count = 0\n            while n:\n                count += n & 1\n                n >>= 1\n            return count\n\n        def price(n):\n            count = 0\n            while n:\n                if n & 1:\n                    count += 1\n                n >>= 1\n            return count\n\n        num = 1\n        while k >= price(num):\n            k -= price(num)\n            num += 1\n\n        return num - 1\n```\n\nIn this code, `count_set_bits` is a helper function that counts the number of set bits in a number. `price` is another helper function that calculates the price of a number. The main function `findMaximumNumber` starts from the number 1 and checks if its price is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, it subtracts the price from `k` and moves to the next number. If it's not, it moves to the next number. The function returns the number before the one that made `k` negative.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(k) because in the worst case, we need to check `k` numbers. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space.\n", "The problem can be solved by using a greedy approach. We start from the number 1 and iteratively increase the number by 1 each time. For each number, we calculate its price and subtract the price from `k`. If `k` becomes less than 0, we stop and return the current number minus 1.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def findMaximumNumber(self, k: int, x: int) -> int:\n        def get_price(num):\n            return bin(num).count('1')\n        \n        num = 1\n        while k >= 0:\n            price = get_price(num)\n            if price % x == 0:\n                k -= price\n            if k < 0:\n                return num - 1\n            num += 1\n```\n\nIn the code above, `get_price` function is used to calculate the price of a number. It counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of the number. If the price of a number is divisible by `x`, we subtract the price from `k`. If `k` becomes less than 0, we return the current number minus 1.\n\nPlease note that the time complexity of this solution is O(k) because in the worst case, we need to iterate over `k` numbers. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the number and its price.\n", "The problem can be solved by using binary search.\n\nWe can start by initializing the left and right pointers to 1 and k respectively. Then, we can calculate the middle number and the sum of prices of numbers from 1 to middle number. If the sum of prices is less than or equal to k, we update the left pointer to middle + 1. Otherwise, we update the right pointer to middle. We continue this process until the left pointer is greater than the right pointer. The maximum number that the sum of prices of all numbers from 1 to the number is less than or equal to k is the right pointer.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def findMaximumNumber(self, k: int, x: int) -> int:\n        def get_price(num):\n            return bin(num).count('1')\n\n        left, right = 1, k\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            total_price = sum(get_price(i) for i in range(1, mid + 1) if i % x == 0)\n            if total_price <= k:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        return right\n```\n\nIn the above code, the function get_price(num) calculates the price of a number by counting the number of set bits in its binary representation. The binary search is performed in the while loop. The total_price is calculated by summing the prices of all numbers from 1 to mid that are divisible by x. If the total_price is less than or equal to k, we update left to mid + 1. Otherwise, we update right to mid - 1. The loop continues until left is greater than right. Finally, we return right as the maximum number that the sum of prices of all numbers from 1 to the number is less than or equal to k.\n", "This problem can be solved using a binary search approach. We start by defining the range of possible numbers from 1 to k. We then calculate the mid number and check if the sum of prices of numbers from 1 to mid is less than or equal to k. If it is, we update the left pointer to mid + 1. If it is not, we update the right pointer to mid. We continue this process until the left pointer is greater than the right pointer. The maximum number that the sum of prices of all numbers from 1 to that number is less than or equal to k is the right pointer.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findMaximumNumber(self, k: int, x: int) -> int:\n        def get_price(num):\n            return sum(1 for i in bin(num)[2:] if i == '1' and int(i) % x == 0)\n\n        left, right = 1, k\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if sum(get_price(i) for i in range(1, mid + 1)) <= k:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        return right\n```\n\nIn the above code, the function `get_price` calculates the price of a number. It converts the number to its binary representation, counts the number of set bits that are divisible by `x`, and returns the count. The binary search is performed in the `findMaximumNumber` function.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input `k` and `x` are integers and that `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `x` is between 1 and 8.

The idea is to start from the initial state (x, y) and perform all possible operations. Then, for each new state, check if it has been visited before. If not, add it to the queue and mark it as visited. Repeat this process until we reach the state where x and y are equal.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOperationsToMakeEqual(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:\n        if x == y:\n            return 0\n        queue = deque([(x, y, 0)])\n        visited = set([(x, y)])\n        while queue:\n            x, y, steps = queue.popleft()\n            for dx, dy in [(11, 0), (5, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 11), (0, 5), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if nx == ny:\n                    return steps + 1\n                if (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append((nx, ny, steps + 1))\n        return -1\n```\n\nIn the code above, we use a deque to implement the queue. Each element in the queue is a tuple (x, y, steps), where x and y are the current values of x and y, and steps is the number of operations we have performed so far. We also use a set to keep track of the visited states.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^2) where n is the maximum of x and y. The space complexity is also O(n^2) because in the worst case, we may need to store all the states in the queue and the set.\n", "You can solve this problem by using a greedy approach. The idea is to make `x` equal to `y` by performing the operations in the order of decreasing the difference between `x` and `y`.\n\nHere is a Python solution using a greedy approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOperationsToMakeEqual(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:\n        if x == y:\n            return 0\n        elif x > y:\n            return self.minimumOperationsToMakeEqual(x-y, y) + 1\n        else:\n            return self.minimumOperationsToMakeEqual(y, x)\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first check if `x` and `y` are already equal. If they are, we return 0 since no operations are needed.\n\nIf `x` is greater than `y`, we decrement `x` by `y` and add 1 to the result of the recursive call with the new `x` and `y` values. This is because we can make `x` equal to `y` by decrementing `x` by `y`.\n\nIf `x` is less than `y`, we swap `x` and `y` and perform the same operation. This is because we can make `x` equal to `y` by swapping `x` and `y` and then performing the operations on the new `x` and `y` values.\n\nThis solution works because it always makes the most efficient operation (decrementing `x` by `y` or swapping `x` and `y`) that brings `x` closer to `y`. By doing this repeatedly, we ensure that the minimum number of operations are used to make `x` and `y` equal.\n", "This problem can be solved by using a simple while loop to decrement or increment x until it equals y. The operations are performed in the order of dividing by 11, then 5, then incrementing or decrementing.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOperationsToMakeEqual(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:\n        operations = 0\n        while x != y:\n            if x > y:\n                if x % 11 == 0:\n                    x = x // 11\n                elif x % 5 == 0:\n                    x = x // 5\n                else:\n                    x -= 1\n            else:\n                if y % 11 == 0:\n                    y = y // 11\n                elif y % 5 == 0:\n                    y = y // 5\n                else:\n                    y -= 1\n            operations += 1\n        return operations\n```\n\nThis solution works by continuously reducing the larger of the two numbers until they are equal. The operations are performed in the order of dividing by 11, then 5, then incrementing or decrementing. The number of operations is incremented each time an operation is performed. The loop continues until x and y are equal.

Then, it uses depth-first search to count the number of powerful integers in the range `[start..finish]`.\n\nThe depth-first search function `dfs` takes four arguments: `pos` is the current position in the string `s`, `is_limit` indicates whether the current digit is the limit digit, `is_num` indicates whether the current number is a valid number, and `mod` is the current modulus value. The function returns the number of powerful integers that can be formed with the current state.\n\nThe base case for the depth-first search is when `pos` is `-1`, which means all digits have been processed. If `is_num` is `True`, it means a valid number has been formed, so it returns `1`. Otherwise, it returns `0`.\n\nIn the recursive step, the function iterates over each possible digit `d` from `0` to `up` (the limit digit if `is_limit` is `True`, otherwise `limit`). If `d` is `0` and `is_num` is `False`, it means the current number is not a valid number, so it skips this digit. Otherwise, it forms a new number by appending `d` to the current number and recursively calls `dfs` with the updated state.\n\nFinally, the solution returns the number of powerful integers in the range `[start..finish]` by subtracting the number of powerful integers in the range `[1..start-1]` from the number of powerful integers in the range `[1..finish]`.

Otherwise, we return False.\n\nPlease note that the `bin` function in Python returns a string that starts with '0b' to indicate that it's a binary number, so we use `[2:]` to get rid of the '0b'.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input list `nums` contains only positive integers.

The `[-2:]` slice gets the last two characters of the string, which represent the last two bits of the binary number. If these bits are '00', that means the number has at least one trailing zero.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

If it is, then we know that the bitwise OR of this number with any other number in the array will have at least one trailing zero, so we return True.

Then, in each round, Alice and Bob both remove the smallest element from the queue, and append it to the result array in alternating order. If there is only one element left in the queue, it is appended to the result array as is.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the heap operations, where n is the number of elements in the input array.

If the heap is not empty after Alice or Bob removes the minimum element, they will continue to remove and append the minimum element.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because each insertion and deletion in a heap takes O(log n) time, and we do this n times.

Then it iterates over the source and target strings, updating the dp array based on the conditions given in the problem. If it is not possible to convert the source string to the target string, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the minimum cost.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n * m) where n is the length of the source string and m is the length of the target string. The space complexity is also O(n * m) as we use a 2D dynamic programming array.\n", "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

If we match them, we add the cost of the operation to dp[i-1][j-1]. If we don't match them, we add the cost of the operation to dp[i-1][j]. We take the minimum of these two options.\n\nIn addition, we need to handle the case where we can match multiple characters of source with a single character of target. We can do this by iterating over all possible lengths of the substring in source and check if it matches with the current character of target.

The base case is `dp[0][0] = 1`, because there is only one way to partition an empty array into good subarrays.\n\nThe transition function is `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]` if the current number is distinct from the previous numbers, and `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]` if the current number is the same as the previous numbers.\n\nThe answer is the sum of `dp[n][j]` for all `j`, where `n` is the length of the array.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfGoodPartitions(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n        dp[0][0] = 1\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            for j in range(i+1):\n                if j > 0:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j]) % MOD\n        return sum(dp[-1]) % MOD\n```\n\nThis code first initializes the dynamic programming table `dp` with all zeros.

This can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\nThe base cases for the dynamic programming are:\n\n- `dp[0] = 1`, because there is only one way to arrange 0 elements in `n` positions.\n- `dp[1] = 2`, because there are two ways to arrange 1 element in `n` positions: either it is at the first position or it is at the second position.\n\nThe recursive case is:\n\n- `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]`, because if we want to arrange `i` elements in `n` positions, we can either place the `i`th element at the `i`th position and arrange the `i - 1` elements in the `i - 2` positions, or we can place the `i`th element at the `i - 1`th position and arrange the `i - 1` elements in the `i - 1` positions.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the infected children in a way that they are not adjacent to any non-infected children. This is a problem of finding the number of ways to arrange `k` elements in `n` positions where no two elements are adjacent. This can be solved using the same dynamic programming approach as above.\n\nThe final answer is the product of the number of ways to arrange the non-infected children and the number of ways to arrange the infected children.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfSequence(self, n: int, sick: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        k = n - len(sick)\n        dp = [0] * (k + 1)\n        dp[0] = 1\n        dp[1] = 2\n        for i in range(2, k + 1):\n            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD\n        return (dp[k] * dp[k]) % MOD\n```\n\nThis code works in `O(n)` time and `O(n)` space.\n"], "input_token_count": 1187, "output_token_counts": [740, 696, 470, 674, 629], "total_token_counts": [1927, 1883, 1657, 1861, 1816], "thinking_time": [187.0, 282.0, 199.0, 171.0, 115.0], "average_thinking_time": 185.66666666666666, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "pass_rate": 0.0}

If the smallest number in the current window is smaller than the smallest number in the array, we can swap the smallest number in the current window with the smallest number in the array.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lexicographicallySmallestArray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(nums)\n        pq = nums[:]\n        heapq.heapify(pq)\n        res = [0] * n\n        i = 0\n        while pq:\n            min_num = heapq.heappop(pq)\n            j = i\n            while j < n and nums[j] != min_num:\n                j += 1\n            for k in range(j, max(i - limit, 0), -1):\n                nums[k], nums[k - 1] = nums[k - 1], nums[k]\n            res[i] = min_num\n            i += 1\n        return res\n```\n\nThis solution works by maintaining a priority queue of the numbers in the array. It then iterates through the array, popping the smallest number from the queue and swapping it with the smallest number in the current window. The window size is determined by the limit. The process is repeated until the queue is empty.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because we are using a priority queue and the sliding window. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the numbers in the array and the queue.\n", "This problem can be solved using a priority queue and a sliding window. The idea is to keep track of the smallest number in the current window of size `limit` and replace each number in the array with the smallest number in the window.\n\nHere is the Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lexicographicallySmallestArray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(nums)\n        heap = nums[:limit]\n        heapq.heapify(heap)\n        ans = [0] * n\n        for i in range(limit, n):\n            ans[i - limit] = heapq.heappop(heap)\n            heapq.heappush(heap, max(nums[i], heap[0] + 1))\n        while heap:\n            ans[n - limit] = heapq.heappop(heap)\n            n -= 1\n        return ans\n```\n\nThis solution works by maintaining a min heap of size `limit`. The heap is initialized with the first `limit` numbers in the array. For each number in the array, we pop the smallest number from the heap and push the maximum between the current number and the smallest number in the heap plus one. This ensures that the smallest number in the heap is always the smallest number in the current window of size `limit`.\n\nAfter processing all numbers in the array, we pop the remaining numbers from the heap and add them to the answer array. The answer array is the lexicographically smallest array that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n log n) because we perform a heap operation for each number in the array.

If the difference minus `k` is in the dictionary, add the count of that key to the result. Then increment the count of the current key in the dictionary.\n\nThe reason we use `v - c` as the key is because we want to find substrings where the count of vowels and consonants are equal. If we find a substring where the count of vowels and consonants are equal, we can form a new substring by adding one more character to the end of the current substring.\n\nThe reason we use `count.get(key - k, 0)` is because we want to find substrings where the count of vowels and consonants are divisible by `k`.

For each character, we update the counters `vowels` and `consonants`. If the current window satisfies the conditions, we increment the result and move the `left` pointer to the right.

The offer is that if you buy the `i`th fruit, you can get the next `i` fruits for free.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to sort the prices in descending order and then add up the prices of the fruits that are not free. The reason for sorting in descending order is that the fruits that are not free will be at the end of the list, so we want to buy them as cheaply as possible.\n\nHere is a Python solution that follows this approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCoins(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n        prices.sort(reverse=True)\n        total_coins = 0\n        for i in range(len(prices)):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                total_coins += prices[i]\n        return total_coins\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first sort the prices in descending order. Then we iterate over the prices, and if the index is even (which means we are on a fruit that is not free), we add the price to the total coins. Finally, we return the total coins.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of fruits. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.\n", "Here is a Python solution using the built-in sort function. The idea is to sort the prices in descending order and then add up the first n elements, where n is the floor of the length of the list divided by 3. This is because for every three fruits, we can get the third one for free.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCoins(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n        prices.sort(reverse=True)\n        return sum(prices[i] for i in range(len(prices) // 3))\n```\n\nThis solution works because we are essentially buying the most expensive fruits first, and then for every three fruits, we are buying the third one for free. This way, we minimize the total cost.\n", "Here is a Python solution that sorts the prices in descending order and then sums up the first half of the array. This is because the offer allows you to take the next `i` fruits for free, so you should always take the most expensive fruits first.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCoins(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n        prices.sort(reverse=True)\n        return sum(prices[i] for i in range(len(prices)//2))\n```\n\nThis solution works because the offer allows you to take the next `i` fruits for free, so you should always take the most expensive fruits first. Therefore, by sorting the prices in descending order, you ensure that you always take the most expensive fruits first. By summing up the first half of the array, you are effectively taking the most expensive fruits for free, and then buying the remaining fruits at their original price.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of fruits.

The final answer is the last element of dp, which is the maximum product for all x < 2^n. The modulo operation is applied at the end to ensure the answer fits within the required range.\n", "The problem is asking for the maximum value of `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)` where `0 <= x < 2^n`. The XOR operation is a bitwise operation that takes two bits and returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.\n\nThe maximum value of `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)` can be achieved when `a` and `b` have the same bits in their binary representation. This is because XOR of a bit with itself is 0, and XOR of a bit with 0 is the bit itself. \n\nTherefore, we can find the maximum value by setting the bits of `x` to be the same as the bits of `a` or `b`. \n\nHere is a Python solution that uses bit manipulation to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumXorProduct(self, a: int, b: int, n: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        x = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if a & (1 << i) or b & (1 << i):\n                x |= 1 << i\n        return (a * b * x) % MOD\n```\n\nIn this solution, we iterate over the bits of `a` and `b` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. If the `i`-th bit of `a` or `b` is 1, we set the `i`-th bit of `x` to 1. Finally, we return the product of `a`, `b`, and `x` modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThis solution works because it maximizes the number of 1s in `x`, which maximizes the value of `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)`.\n", "This problem can be solved using bit manipulation and dynamic programming.\n\nThe maximum value of `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)` is achieved when the XOR of `a` and `b` are as close as possible, because XOR operation will make the result as large as possible.\n\nFirst, convert `a` and `b` to binary format. Then, for each bit of `a` and `b`, if they are different, we need to flip the bit of `a` to make it as close as possible to `b`.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumXorProduct(self, a: int, b: int, n: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        a = bin(a)[2:].zfill(n)\n        b = bin(b)[2:].zfill(n)\n        dp = [0] * n\n        dp[0] = [(0, 0), (1, 1)][(a[0] == '1') ^ (b[0] == '1')]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            dp[i] = (dp[i-1] << 1) % MOD\n            if a[i] == '1':\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-1] + 2**i)\n            if b[i] == '1':\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-1] + 2**i)\n        return dp[-1]\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over each bit of `a` and `b`. For each bit, if `a` and `b` are different, we flip the bit of `a` to make it as close as possible to `b`. The maximum value of `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)` is stored in `dp`.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of bits in `a` or `b`.\n"], "input_token_count": 608, "output_token_counts": [589, 212, 430, 431, 495], "total_token_counts": [1197, 820, 1038, 1039, 1103], "thinking_time": [230.0, 247.0, 263.0, 278.0, 352.0], "average_thinking_time": 262.6666666666667, "results": [false, true, true, false, false], "pass_rate": 0.4}

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the input list.\n", "This problem can be solved by using bitwise operations and sorting. The idea is to sort the array in descending order and then iterate through the array to find the maximum XOR value of two numbers that satisfy the condition `|x - y| <= min(x, y)`.\n\nHere is a Python solution using bitwise operations and sorting:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumStrongPairXor(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        nums.sort(reverse=True)\n        max_xor = 0\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):\n                if nums[i] & nums[j] >= min(nums[i], nums[j]):\n                    max_xor = max(max_xor, nums[i] ^ nums[j])\n        return max_xor\n```\n\nThis solution works by first sorting the array in descending order. Then, it iterates through the array and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the bitwise AND of the two numbers is greater than or equal to the minimum of the two numbers. If it is, it calculates the XOR of the two numbers and updates the maximum XOR value if the XOR value is greater than the current maximum XOR value. Finally, it returns the maximum XOR value.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because it uses two nested loops to iterate through the array. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the maximum XOR value.\n", "The problem is to find the maximum XOR value of two numbers in the array such that the absolute difference between them is less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to realize that the maximum XOR value will always be obtained when the two numbers are as close as possible. This is because the XOR operation will set the bits of the result to 1 only if the corresponding bits in the two numbers are different. Therefore, the closer the two numbers are, the more bits will be set to 1 in the XOR result.\n\nTo find the maximum XOR value, we can sort the array in ascending order and then iterate over the array to find the maximum XOR value. For each number, we can find the maximum number that can be XORed with it to get the maximum XOR value.\n\nHere is a Python solution that implements the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumStrongPairXor(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        max_xor = 0\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            max_xor = max(max_xor, nums[i] ^ nums[i - 1])\n        return max_xor\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first sort the array in ascending order. Then we initialize `max_xor` to 0. For each number in the array, we calculate the XOR of the current number and the previous number and update `max_xor` if the XOR value is greater than `max_xor`. Finally, we return `max_xor`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the array.

Similarly, for each character at odd position, add its count to the count of '0's at odd positions and add its count to the count of '1's at even positions.\n\nFinally, the minimum number of changes required to make the string beautiful is the minimum of the count of '0's at even positions and the count of '1's at even positions, and the count of '0's at odd positions and the count of '1's at odd positions.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the above approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minChanges(self, s: str) -> int:\n        count_even_0 = count_even_1 = count_odd_0 = count_odd_1 = 0\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                if s[i] == '0':\n                    count_even_0 += 1\n                else:\n                    count_even_1 += 1\n            else:\n                if s[i] == '0':\n                    count_odd_0 += 1\n                else:\n                    count_odd_1 += 1\n        return min(count_even_0 + count_odd_1, count_even_1 + count_odd_0)\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the string.\n", "This problem can be solved by using a greedy approach and dynamic programming.\n\nFirstly, we can observe that if we can partition the string into substrings of even length and each substring contains only 1's or only 0's, then the string must have the same number of 1's and 0's. This is because each substring must have an even length, and if it contains only 1's or only 0's, it must contain half the length of the string.\n\nTherefore, we can count the number of 1's and 0's in the string and calculate the difference between the two counts. This difference is the number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.\n\nHowever, this approach is not enough to solve the problem. We need to consider the case where the string has multiple substrings of even length, each containing only 1's or only 0's. In this case, we need to change the characters in the substrings to make them beautiful.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (n+1), where n is the length of the string. dp[i][j] will store the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring from index i to j beautiful.\n\nWe can initialize dp[i][i] to 0 for all i from 0 to n.

Therefore, we", "You can solve this problem using a sliding window approach. \n\nThe idea is to use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define a window. We start from the leftmost element and keep moving the right pointer to the right until we find a duplicate of the current element. At this point, we know that all elements in the current window are distinct. We then move the left pointer to the right and repeat the process until we have processed all elements.\n\nWe keep a count of the number of distinct elements in each window and add the square of this count to a running total.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def sumCounts(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        left = 0\n        right = 0\n        count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        res = 0\n        while right < n:\n            count[nums[right]] += 1\n            while left < right and count[nums[right]] > 1:\n                count[nums[left]] -= 1\n                left += 1\n            res = (res + (right - left + 1) * (right - left + 1)) % MOD\n            right += 1\n        return res\n```\n\nIn this code, `count` is a dictionary that keeps track of the count of each number in the current window. `res` is the running total of the squares of the distinct counts. The inner while loop moves the left pointer to the right until all elements in the current window are distinct. The outer while loop moves the right pointer to the right until we have processed all elements. The line `res = (res + (right - left + 1) * (right - left + 1)) % MOD` adds the square of the count of distinct elements in the current window to `res`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.\n"], "input_token_count": 586, "output_token_counts": [413, 378, 411, 2025, 462], "total_token_counts": [999, 964, 997, 2611, 1048], "thinking_time": [217.0, 236.0, 283.0, 195.0, 273.0], "average_thinking_time": 242.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "pass_rate": 0.0}

For each possible split, we calculate the minimum number of changes to make the first `i` characters into `j` semi-palindromes.\n\nFinally, we return `dp[n][k]` as the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumChanges(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(s)\n        dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        for i in range(n + 1):\n            for j in range(min(i + 1, k + 1)):\n                if j == 0:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + i\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + (s[i - 1] != s[j - 1]), dp[i - 1][j] + 1)\n        return dp[n][k]\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of `O(n^2 * k)` and a space complexity of `O(n * k)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `k` is the given integer.\n", "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to use dp[i][j] to represent the minimum changes to make the string s[i:j+1] into a semi-palindrome.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the cost of changing all characters in the string to a specific character. This can be done using a prefix sum array.\n\nThen, we can use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum changes for each substring. For each substring, we try all possible lengths of the first substring and calculate the minimum changes.\n\nFinally, we return the minimum changes for the whole string.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumChanges(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(s)\n        cost = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(k)]\n        dp = [0] + [n] * k\n        dp2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n // k):\n            for j in range(k):\n                cost[j][ord(s[i * k + j]) - ord('a')] += 1\n        for i in range(k, n):\n            for j in range(k):\n                dp2[j + 1] = min(dp[j] + n - i + j, dp2[j])\n            dp, dp2 = dp2, [0] * (n + 1)\n        return dp[n % k]\n```\n\nThis code works by first calculating the cost of changing all characters in the string to a specific character. Then, it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum changes for each substring.

If the count of '1's is equal to `k` and the set of vowels contains all the vowels and the length of the substring is less than the current minimum length, it updates the minimum length and the minimum substring.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.\n", "Here is a Python solution that uses a sliding window approach to find the shortest and lexicographically smallest beautiful substring.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestBeautifulSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}\n        min_len = float('inf')\n        res = ''\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] != '1':\n                continue\n            count = {'a': 0, 'e': 0, 'i': 0, 'o': 0, 'u': 0}\n            j = i\n            while j < len(s) and len(vowels) > 0:\n                if s[j] in vowels:\n                    vowels.remove(s[j])\n                count[s[j]] += 1\n                j += 1\n            if len(vowels) == 0 and all(v == k for v in count.values()):\n                if j - i < min_len:\n                    min_len = j - i\n                    res = s[i:j]\n        return res\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over the string `s` and for each '1' it finds, it tries to find a substring that contains exactly `k` '1's. It uses a sliding window approach where the start of the window is the current '1' and the end of the window is the next '1' after the current window. It also keeps track of the count of each vowel in the current window. If the current window contains exactly `k` '1's and all vowels are present, it updates the result if the current window is shorter than the previous minimum length.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^2) where n is the length of the string `s`. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the counts of each vowel.\n", "This problem can be solved by using a sliding window approach. We start by initializing the left pointer to 0 and the right pointer to the length of the string. We then iterate through the string from left to right, incrementing the right pointer if the number of 1's is less than k, and decrementing the left pointer if the number of 1's is more than k. If the number of 1's is equal to k, we check if the substring is beautiful. If it is, we update the result if it's shorter than the current result or if it's the same length but lexicographically smaller. If it's not, we increment the right pointer.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestBeautifulSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        n = len(s)\n        res = \"\"\n        for i in range(n):\n            if s[i] == '1':\n                ones = 1\n                for j in range(i+1, n):\n                    if s[j] == '1':\n                        ones += 1\n                    if ones == k:\n                        sub = s[i:j+1]\n                        if self.isBeautiful(sub, k) and (len(res) > len(sub) or (len(res) == len(sub) and res > sub)):\n                            res = sub\n                        break\n        return res\n\n    def isBeautiful(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:\n        count = [0]*26\n        for c in s:\n            count[ord(c)-ord('a')] += 1\n        for i in range(k):\n            if count[i] == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n```\n\nIn this solution, `isBeautiful` function checks if a substring is beautiful or not. It counts the number of each character in the substring and checks if the count of the first `k` characters is non-zero. If it's zero, it means that the substring doesn't contain all the characters from 'a' to 'a'+k-1, so it's not beautiful.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string.

Then for each cell in the product matrix, it divides the product of all elements in the corresponding row and column by the element in the original matrix. The division is done using the modular multiplicative inverse, which is calculated using the pow function with the third argument as 12345 - 2. The pow function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number under modulo 12345.\n", "Here is a Python solution using the built-in `functools.reduce` function to calculate the product of all elements in each row and column.

Then for each cell in the product matrix, we calculate the product of the product of the row and the product of the column, and take the modulo 12345.\n\nThe `pow(col_products[j], n - 2, 12345)` is used to calculate the inverse of the product of the column, which is equivalent to dividing the product of the row by the product of the column. The `pow` function with three arguments calculates the power of the first argument to the second argument, and then takes the modulo of the result by the third argument.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. The space complexity is also O(n * m) because we store the product of each row and each column.\n", "The problem can be solved by first calculating the product of all elements in the grid and then for each element in the grid, divide the total product by the element at that position.

Then for each element in the grid, it calculates the product of all elements except the current one by dividing the total product by the current element. The result is then modulo 12345 to ensure it fits within the given constraints.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n and m are the dimensions of the grid.

The answer is the sum of the number of ways to form the sum from l to r.\n\nHere is the Python solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countSubMultisets(self, nums: List[int], l: int, r: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        dp = [0] * (r + 1)\n        dp[0] = 1\n        for num in nums:\n            for i in range(r, num - 1, -1):\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - num]) % MOD\n        return sum(dp[l:]) % MOD\n```\n\nIn the above code, `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to form a sum of `i`. We initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there is one way to form a sum of 0, which is to not choose any number. For each number in the array, we update the dp array by adding the number of ways to form the sum from 0 to `r - num` to the number of ways to form the sum from 0 to `l - num - 1`. The answer is the sum of the number of ways to form the sum from `l` to `r`.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nr) and the space complexity is O(r), where n is the length of the array and r is the upper limit of the sum.\n", "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\nWe can create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to get a sum of `j` using the first `i` elements of `nums`.\n\nWe can initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1, since there is one way to get a sum of 0 using no elements.\n\nThen, for each element `num` in `nums`, we update `dp` as follows:\n\n- For each `j` from `0` to `r`, we add `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i + 1][j]`.\n- For each `j` from `num` to `r`, we add `dp[i][j - num]` to `dp[i + 1][j]`.\n\nFinally, we return the sum of `dp[n][j]` for `j` from `l` to `r`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countSubMultisets(self, nums: List[int], l: int, r: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [[0]*(r + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        dp[0][0] = 1\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            for j in range(r + 1):\n                dp[i + 1][j] = dp[i][j]\n                if j >= num:\n                    dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j - num]\n                dp[i + 1][j] %= MOD\n        return sum(dp[n][j] for j in range(l, r + 1)) % MOD\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n*r) and a space complexity of O(n*r), where `n` is the length of `nums` and `r` is the maximum sum.\n", "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\nFirst, we need to sort the array in ascending order.

The score of a subarray is the bitwise AND of all its elements.\n\nThe strategy to solve this problem is to find the maximum number of subarrays that can be formed by finding the maximum number of consecutive zeros in the array. This is because the score of a subarray containing only zeros is zero. Therefore, we can split the array into subarrays containing only zeros and the rest of the elements will be in separate subarrays.\n\nHere is the Python solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize the count of zeros and the maximum count of zeros\n        count_zeros = 0\n        max_zeros = 0\n\n        # Iterate over the array\n        for num in nums:\n            # If the current number is zero, increment the count of zeros\n            if num == 0:\n                count_zeros += 1\n            else:\n                # If the current number is not zero, update the maximum count of zeros\n                max_zeros = max(max_zeros, count_zeros)\n                # Reset the count of zeros\n                count_zeros = 0\n\n        # Update the maximum count of zeros one last time\n        max_zeros = max(max_zeros, count_zeros)\n\n        # The maximum number of subarrays is the maximum count of zeros plus one\n        return max_zeros + 1\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over the array and counting the number of consecutive zeros. When a non-zero number is encountered, the maximum count of zeros is updated and the count of zeros is reset. The maximum count of zeros is updated one last time after the loop. The maximum number of subarrays is the maximum count of zeros plus one.\n", "The problem is asking to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of the bitwise AND of each subarray is the minimum possible.

This is because the bitwise AND of any number with 0 is 0. Therefore, the best way to minimize the sum of the bitwise AND of each subarray is to make each subarray as small as possible.\n\nThe maximum number of subarrays that can be formed is equal to the number of unique elements in the array. This is because each unique element can be considered as a subarray.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        return len(set(nums))\n```\n\nThis code works by converting the list of numbers into a set, which automatically removes any duplicates.

The reason is that if the total number of selected students is strictly greater than the number of students who are not happy, then the group is happy. \n\nSo, we can convert this problem into a problem of finding the number of ways to select a group of students that is not happy. \n\nWe can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We can create a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i] is the number of ways to select a group of students that is not happy if we only consider the first i students. \n\nThe base case of the dynamic programming is dp[0] = 1 because there is only one way to select a group of students that is not happy if we consider no student. \n\nFor each i from 1 to n, we can calculate dp[i] as follows:\n\n1. If nums[i] is greater than i, then we can select the i-th student to form the group. So, dp[i] += dp[i-1].\n\n2. If nums[i] is less than or equal to i, then we cannot select the i-th student to form the group. So, dp[i] += dp[i-1].\n\nFinally, the number of ways to select a group of students so that everyone remains happy is 2^n - dp[n], where 2^n is the total number of ways to select a group of students and dp[n] is the number of ways to select a group of students that is not happy. \n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countWays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n        dp[0] = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] * 2 % (10**9 + 7)\n            if nums[i - 1] >= i:\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[i - 1]) % (10**9 + 7)\n        return (dp[n] - 1) % (10**9 + 7)\n```\n\nThis code first calculates the number of ways to select a group of students that is not happy. Then, it subtracts this number from 2^n to get the number of ways to select a group of students so that everyone remains happy. The result is modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow.\n", "This problem can be solved using the concept of combinatorics and dynamic programming.\n\nFirst, we need to sort the array `nums` in descending order. The reason for this is that we want to select the students with higher numbers first. This is because if we select a student with a higher number, it will increase the total number of selected students, which might make some students happy.\n\nNext, we calculate the factorial of the length of `nums` and the factorial of the count of each number in `nums`. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. We need to calculate the factorial of the length of `nums` and the factorial of the count of each number in `nums` because we will use these factorials to calculate the number of ways to select a group of students.\n\nAfter that, we calculate the number of ways to select a group of students. We do this by iterating over `nums` and for each number, we calculate the number of ways to select a group of students with that number as the maximum number. We do this by calculating the number of ways to select the number itself and the number of ways to select the remaining numbers. The number of ways to select the number itself is the factorial of the count of the number in `nums` divided by the product of the factorial of the count of the number and the factorial of the length of `nums`. The number of ways to select the remaining numbers is the factorial of the length of `nums` minus the count of the number in `nums` divided by the product of the factorial of the length of `nums` and the factorial of the count of the number. We add these two numbers to get the total number of ways to select a group of students with that number as the maximum number.\n\nFinally, we return the total number of ways to select a group of students.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\nfrom math import factorial\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countWays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        nums.sort(reverse=True)\n        fact = [1] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % MOD\n        inv = [1] * (n + 1)\n        inv[n] = pow(fact[n], MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n            inv[i - 1] = inv[i] * i % MOD\n        cnt = Counter(nums)\n        ans = 1\n        for num in cnt:\n            ans = ans * fact[cnt[num]] % MOD\n            ans = ans * inv[cnt[num]] % MOD\n        return ans\n```\n\nThis code first calculates the factorial and the inverse factorial of the length of `nums`. Then it calculates the number of ways to select a group of students for each number in `nums`. Finally, it returns the product of all these numbers. The time complexity of this code is O(n log n) because of the sorting.

We then iterate over the array with the `right` pointer. If the current element satisfies the condition `nums[right] % modulo == k`, we increment the count by the number of subarrays that can be formed from the current window (which is `right - left + 1`). If the current element does not satisfy the condition, we move the `left` pointer to the position right after the current `right` pointer.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the count.\n", "This problem can be solved using a prefix sum and a hashmap.\n\nFirst, we initialize a hashmap `count` to store the count of each number modulo `modulo`. Then we initialize a variable `prefix` to store the prefix sum modulo `modulo`.\n\nNext, we iterate through the array `nums`. For each number `num`, we calculate `num % modulo` and add it to `prefix`. If `prefix == k`, we increment the count of `prefix` in the hashmap.\n\nFinally, we iterate through the hashmap and for each count `c`, we add `c * (c - 1) // 2` to the result.

We then slide the window to the right and repeat the process.\n\nHere is the Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countInterestingSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], modulo: int, k: int) -> int:\n        count = [0] * modulo\n        left = right = 0\n        ans = curr = 0\n        while right < len(nums):\n            count[nums[right] % modulo] += 1\n            if nums[right] % modulo == k:\n                curr += 1\n            right += 1\n            while curr >= k and count[nums[left] % modulo] > k:\n                count[nums[left] % modulo] -= 1\n                if nums[left] % modulo == k:\n                    curr -= 1\n                left += 1\n            if curr >= k:\n                ans += left - sum(count[:modulo]) + 1\n        return ans\n```\n\nThis solution works by first initializing a count array to keep track of the count of numbers in the current window that are divisible by `modulo` and have a remainder of `k`.

It keeps track of the total sum of the array and the number of operations. If the total sum is less than the target, it returns -1 as it's impossible to get a subsequence that sums up to the target. If the total sum is greater than or equal to the target, it returns the number of operations.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) where n is the length of the array. This is because each operation in the while loop involves a heap operation which takes O(log n) time. The space complexity is O(n) as we are storing the array in a heap.\n", "This problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm with priority queue.

Then we keep popping the largest number from the heap, divide it by 2 and push it back to the heap until the sum of the array is less than or equal to the target. The number of operations is the number of times we popped the largest number from the heap.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n log n) where n is the length of the array.

In each iteration, we pop the maximum number from the priority queue and divide it by 2. If the number is still greater than 1, we add it back to the priority queue.

Then, we use the previous results to calculate the current result.\n\nFinally, we sum up the results for all numbers in the range.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfBeautifulIntegers(self, low: int, high: int, k: int) -> int:\n        low, high = str(low - 1), str(high)\n        n, m = len(high), len(low)\n        dp = [[[[0] * k for _ in range(n * 2 + 1)] for _ in range(n * 2 + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        dp[0][0][0][0] = 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i + 1):\n                for l in range(k):\n                    for x in range(10):\n                        if i == 0 and x == 0:\n                            continue\n                        if x < int(low[i - m + 1]) if i >= m else 0:\n                            dp[i + 1][j + 1][(l * 10 + x) % k][1] += dp[i][j][l][0]\n                        dp[i + 1][j][(l * 10 + x) % k][0] += dp[i][j][l][0]\n                        if x % 2 == 1:\n                            dp[i + 1][j + 1][(l * 10 + x) % k][1] += dp[i][j][l][1]\n                        dp[i + 1][j][(l * 10 + x) % k][0] += dp[i][j][l][1]\n        return sum(dp[n][n // 2][i][1] for i in range(k) if n % 2 == 0)\n```\n\nThis code first initializes the dp array and then iterates over each digit in the range. For each digit, it updates the dp array based on the previous results. Finally, it sums up the results for all numbers in the range.\n", "This problem can be solved by using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the number of beautiful integers with i digits and the remainder of the number modulo k is j. We then iterate over all possible numbers of digits from 1 to the number of digits in high, and for each number of digits, we iterate over all possible remainders modulo k. For each possible remainder, we iterate over all possible digits for the current position (0-9), and update the dp array accordingly.\n\nThe time complexity is O(log(high) * k * 10), and the space complexity is O(log(high) * k).\n\nHere is the Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfBeautifulIntegers(self, low: int, high: int, k: int) -> int:\n        def count(s: str) -> int:\n            n = len(s)\n            dp = [[[0]*k for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n            dp[0][0][0] = 1\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(i+1):\n                    for d in range(10):\n                        for r in range(k):\n                            if i == 0 and d == 0:\n                                continue\n                            ni, nj, nr = i+1, j+(d%2==1), (r*10+d)%k\n                            dp[ni][nj][nr] += dp[i][j][r]\n            res = 0\n            for i in range(n+1):\n                for j in range(k):\n                    res += dp[n][i][j] * dp[i][i][j]\n            return res\n        \n        def solve(n: int) -> int:\n            s = str(n)\n            res = count(s)\n            for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):\n                if i < len(s)-1:\n                    n -= int(s[i+1])*(10**(len(s)-i-1))\n                for d in range(int(s[i])+1, 10):\n                    res += count(str(n-1)+str(d)+'0'*(len(s)-i-1))\n            return res\n        \n        return solve(high+1) - solve(low)\n```\n\nThis solution works by first counting the number of beautiful integers with a certain number of digits and a certain remainder modulo k. Then, it counts the number of beautiful integers less than a certain number by iterating over all possible numbers of digits and all possible digits for the current position. Finally, it subtracts the number of beautiful integers less than low from the number of beautiful integers less than high to get the number of beautiful integers in the range [low, high].\n", "Here is a Python solution using dynamic programming.

The space complexity is O(n) because we create a new list of tuples.\n", "Here is a Python solution using a sliding window approach.\n\n```python\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minAbsoluteDifference(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        sl = SortedList()\n        res = float('inf')\n        for i in range(x, len(nums)):\n            sl.add(nums[i-x])\n            idx = sl.bisect_left(nums[i])\n            if idx < len(sl):\n                res = min(res, sl[idx] - nums[i])\n            if idx > 0:\n                res = min(res, nums[i] - sl[idx-1])\n        return res\n```\n\nThis solution uses a SortedList (from the sortedcontainers module) to keep track of the elements in the current window. For each element in the array, it adds the element `x` indices before it to the SortedList and then finds the closest element in the SortedList to the current element. It then updates the result with the minimum difference between the current element and the closest element in the SortedList.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because of the sorted list and the bisect_left operation. The space complexity is O(n) because of the sorted list.\n\nThe bisect_left operation is used to find the position at which an element should be inserted to maintain sorted order. If the element is already present, the insertion point is before (to the left of) any existing entries.\n\nThe min function is used to keep track of the minimum absolute difference.\n\nThe result is returned at the end.\n", "This problem can be solved using a sliding window and a priority queue.\n\nThe idea is to maintain a sliding window of size `x` and a priority queue of size `x`. The priority queue will store the `x` largest elements in the window. When we move the window, we remove the smallest element from the queue and add the next element to the queue. The minimum absolute difference between two elements in the queue is the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minAbsoluteDifference(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        heap = []\n        min_diff = float('inf')\n        for i in range(x, len(nums)):\n            if len(heap) < x:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, nums[i-x])\n            min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(nums[i] - max(heap)) if heap else float('inf'))\n            if heap and nums[i] >= max(heap):\n                heap.remove(max(heap))\n                heapq.heappush(heap, nums[i-x])\n        return min_diff\n```\n\nIn the code above, we first initialize an empty heap and a variable `min_diff` to infinity. Then we iterate over the array from index `x` to the end. For each index `i`, we first check if the heap has less than `x` elements. If it does, we add the `x`th element from the current index to the heap. Then we calculate the absolute difference between the current element and the maximum element in the heap (if the heap is not empty), and update `min_diff` if the calculated difference is smaller. If the current element is larger than or equal to the maximum element in the heap, we remove the maximum element from the heap and add the `x`th element from the current index to the heap. Finally, we return `min_diff` as the result.\n", "Here is a Python solution using a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the minimum element in the window of size `x` and update the minimum absolute difference as we slide the window.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minAbsoluteDifference(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        window = sorted(nums[:x])\n        min_diff = min(window[i] - window[i-1] for i in range(1, x))\n        for i in range(x, n):\n            j = bisect.bisect_left(window, nums[i])\n            if j < x:\n                min_diff = min(min_diff, window[j] - nums[i])\n            if j > 0:\n                min_diff = min(min_diff, nums[i] - window[j-1])\n            window.pop(bisect.bisect_left(window, nums[i-x+1]))\n            bisect.insort(window, nums[i])\n        return min_diff\n```\n\nThe `bisect` module in Python provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion. The `bisect.bisect_left()` function finds the insertion point for `nums[i]` in `window` to maintain sorted order. The `bisect.insort()` function inserts `nums[i]` at the right place in `window`.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting and binary search operations.

It initializes an empty max heap and two variables `time` and `total` to keep track of the number of operations and the sum of `nums1` after each operation, respectively.\n\n4. It enters a loop that continues until the difference between the total sum of `nums1` and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `nums1`.\n\n5. Inside the loop, it checks if there are no more elements in `diffs` or if the top element of `max_heap` has a smaller `nums2` value than the last element in `diffs`. If so, it pops the top element from `max_heap` and subtracts its value from `total` and `total_sum`. Otherwise, it pops the last element from `diffs`, adds its value to `total` and `total_sum`, and pushes it to `max_heap`.\n\n6. After each iteration, it increments `time` by 1.\n\n7. Finally, it returns `time` if the difference between the total sum of `nums1` and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `nums1`, otherwise it returns -1.\n\nThis solution works in O(n log n) time complexity where n is the length of `nums1` and `nums2`.\n", "This problem can be solved using a priority queue and dynamic programming.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumTime(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums1)\n        diff = [(a, b) for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2)]\n        diff.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])\n        total = sum(nums1)\n        if total <= x:\n            return 0\n        heap = []\n        time = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            a, b = diff[i]\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -a)\n            total -= a\n            time += 1\n            while total > x and heap:\n                total -= -heapq.heappop(heap) // 2\n                time += 1\n            if total <= x:\n                return time\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis solution works by sorting the pairs of `nums1` and `nums2` in decreasing order of `nums2`.

If the number of distinct elements in the dictionary is equal to the target number, you can move the start pointer to the right and remove the element at the start pointer from the dictionary.\n\nYou can repeat this process until the end pointer reaches the end of the array.\n\nFinally, you can return the total number of complete subarrays.\n\nHere is the Python code for this approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def countCompleteSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        distinct_elements = len(set(nums))\n        count = collections.Counter()\n        res = i = 0\n        for j in range(len(nums)):\n            count[nums[j]] += 1\n            while len(count) == distinct_elements:\n                count[nums[i]] -= 1\n                if count[nums[i]] == 0:\n                    del count[nums[i]]\n                i += 1\n            res += i\n        return res\n```\n\nThis code first finds the number of distinct elements in the array. Then it uses a sliding window approach to find all the complete subarrays. The time complexity of this code is O(n) where n is the length of the array.\n", "This problem can be solved by using a sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain two pointers, one for the start of the subarray and one for the end. We keep moving the end pointer until we have all the distinct elements in the subarray. Once we have all the distinct elements, we move the start pointer until we lose a distinct element. At each step, we add the number of subarrays that can be formed from the current subarray to the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countCompleteSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        total_distinct = len(set(nums))\n        count = Counter()\n        left = 0\n        res = 0\n        for right in range(n):\n            count[nums[right]] += 1\n            while len(count) == total_distinct:\n                count[nums[left]] -= 1\n                if count[nums[left]] == 0:\n                    del count[nums[left]]\n                left += 1\n            res += left\n        return res\n```\n\nIn this code, `total_distinct` is the total number of distinct elements in the array. `count` is a counter that keeps track of the number of occurrences of each element in the current subarray. `left` and `right` are the start and end pointers of the subarray. `res` is the total number of complete subarrays.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the array.\n", "Here is a Python solution using two pointers and a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the number of distinct elements in the subarray and the number of distinct elements in the whole array. If the number of distinct elements in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct elements in the whole array, we increment the count of complete subarrays.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countCompleteSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        distinct_elements = len(set(nums))\n        left = 0\n        right = 0\n        count = Counter()\n        complete_subarrays = 0\n\n        while right < n:\n            count[nums[right]] += 1\n\n            while len(count) == distinct_elements:\n                complete_subarrays += n - right\n                count[nums[left]] -= 1\n                if count[nums[left]] == 0:\n                    del count[nums[left]]\n                left += 1\n\n            right += 1\n\n        return complete_subarrays\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first calculate the number of distinct elements in the array. We then use two pointers `left` and `right` to represent the start and end of the subarray. We also use a `Counter` to keep track of the number of distinct elements in the subarray.\n\nWe move the right pointer to the right and update the `Counter`. If the number of distinct elements in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct elements in the whole array, we increment the count of complete subarrays by the number of elements to the right of the right pointer.\n\nThen we move the left pointer to the right and update the `Counter`. If the number of elements at the left pointer is 0, we remove it from the `Counter`.\n\nWe repeat the process until the right pointer reaches the end of the array.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^2) because for each element in the array, we may need to move the left pointer to the right n times. The space complexity is O(n) because we need to store the `Counter` and the `set` of distinct elements.\n"], "input_token_count": 408, "output_token_counts": [484, 412, 395, 399, 507], "total_token_counts": [892, 820, 803, 807, 915], "thinking_time": [79.0, 147.0, 71.0, 112.0, 71.0], "average_thinking_time": 87.33333333333333, "results": [false, true, false, true, true], "pass_rate": 0.6}

The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that scales with the size of the input.\n", "The problem can be solved by iterating the array from right to left and merging the elements if the current element is less than or equal to the next element. The reason for iterating from right to left is to ensure that we always merge the largest possible elements.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxArrayValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        max_val = nums[-1]\n        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n            if nums[i] <= nums[i+1]:\n                nums[i] += nums[i+1]\n                max_val = max(max_val, nums[i])\n            else:\n                max_val = max(max_val, nums[i])\n        return max_val\n```\n\nIn this code, we first initialize `max_val` to be the last element of the array. Then we iterate from right to left. If the current element is less than or equal to the next element, we merge them and update `max_val` if necessary. If the current element is larger than the next element, we just update `max_val` if necessary. Finally, we return `max_val`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space.\n", "The problem is asking to find the maximum possible value in an array after performing certain operations. The operations allowed are to replace the element at index `i+1` with the sum of the elements at index `i` and `i+1` and then delete the element at index `i`.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to realize that we should always choose the largest possible `i` to perform the operation. This is because the operation will increase the value of `nums[i+1]`, and we want to maximize this value.\n\nHere is the Python solution using a greedy approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def maxArrayValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        nums = nums[::-1]\n        max_val = nums[0]\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] >= max_val:\n                max_val = nums[i]\n            else:\n                max_val = max(max_val, nums[i-1] + nums[i])\n        return max_val\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first reverse the array so that we can start from the end. Then, we initialize `max_val` as the first element in the array. For each element in the array, if the current element is greater than or equal to `max_val`, we update `max_val` to be the current element. Otherwise, we update `max_val` to be the maximum of `max_val` and the sum of the current element and the previous element. Finally, we return `max_val` as the maximum possible value in the final array.\n\nThis solution works because it always chooses the largest possible `i` to perform the operation, and it always performs the operation that increases the value of `nums[i+1]`. Therefore, it guarantees that the final array will have the maximum possible value.\n", "You can solve this problem by iterating the array from right to left and merging the elements whenever the current element is less than or equal to the next element.

If the current element is less than or equal to the next element, we merge them by adding the next element to the current element and then update the maximum value if necessary. If the current element is larger than the next element, we simply update the maximum value if necessary.

The idea is to find the dominant element first, then check each possible split to see if it is valid.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        count = [0, 0]\n        candidate = [0, 0]\n        for n in nums:\n            if n == candidate[0]:\n                count[0] += 1\n            elif n == candidate[1]:\n                count[1] += 1\n            elif count[0] == 0:\n                candidate[0] = n\n                count[0] = 1\n            elif count[1] == 0:\n                candidate[1] = n\n                count[1] = 1\n            else:\n                count[0] -= 1\n                count[1] -= 1\n        count = [0, 0]\n        for n in nums:\n            if n == candidate[0]:\n                count[0] += 1\n            if n == candidate[1]:\n                count[1] += 1\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] == candidate[0] and count[0]*2 > len(nums[i:]):\n                return i\n            if nums[i] == candidate[1] and count[1]*2 > len(nums[i:]):\n                return i\n        return -1\n```\n\nThe Boyer-Moore voting algorithm is used to find the dominant element. It works by keeping track of two candidates and their counts. If the current number is one of the candidates, it increases the count. If it is not one of the candidates and there are still slots for candidates, it assigns the current number to a candidate and increases the count. If it is not one of the candidates and there are no slots for candidates, it decreases the count of both candidates.\n\nAfter finding the dominant element, it checks each possible split to see if it is valid. If the dominant element in the left part of the split occurs more than half of the time and the dominant element in the right part of the split occurs more than half of the time, it returns the index of the split. If no valid split is found, it returns -1.\n", "This problem can be solved using prefix sum and frequency count.\n\nFirst, we need to find the dominant element in the array. We can do this by creating a frequency count of each element in the array and then checking if any element's frequency is more than half of the total length of the array.\n\nOnce we have the dominant element, we can create a prefix sum array for the array. The prefix sum array will keep track of the frequency of the dominant element up to each index.\n\nThen, we can iterate through the array from the beginning to the second last index. For each index, we check if the dominant element's frequency up to the current index is more than half of the total length of the array and if the dominant element's frequency up to the next index is more than half of the total length of the array. If both conditions are true, then we have found a valid split and we can return the current index.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        from collections import Counter\n        dominant = Counter(nums).most_common(1)[0][0]\n        prefix_sum = [0] * len(nums)\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + (nums[i] == dominant)\n        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):\n            if prefix_sum[i] * 2 > i + 1 and (prefix_sum[-1] - prefix_sum[i]) * 2 > len(nums) - i - 1:\n                return i\n        return -1\n```\n\nIn the above code, `Counter(nums).most_common(1)[0][0]` is used to find the dominant element in the array. `prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + (nums[i] == dominant)` is used to create the prefix sum array. The `if` condition inside the loop checks if the current index is a valid split. If no valid split is found, `-1` is returned.\n", "The problem is asking for the minimum index where the dominant element in the array can be split into two halves such that each half has the same dominant element.\n\nThe dominant element is the element that occurs more than half the times in the array. We can find the dominant element in the array and count its occurrences.\n\nWe can then iterate through the array and keep track of the count of the dominant element in the left half and the right half of the array. If at any point, the dominant element in the left half has more occurrences than in the right half and the count of dominant elements in the left half is more than the count of dominant elements in the right half, we have found a valid split.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        dominant = max(set(nums), key=nums.count)\n        dominant_count = nums.count(dominant)\n        dominant_count_left = 0\n        dominant_count_right = dominant_count\n        for i in range(len(nums)-1):\n            if nums[i] == dominant:\n                dominant_count_left += 1\n                dominant_count_right -= 1\n            if dominant_count_left*2 > i+1 and dominant_count_right*2 > len(nums)-i-1:\n                return i\n        return -1\n```\n\nIn the code above, `max(set(nums), key=nums.count)` is used to find the dominant element in the array. `nums.count(dominant)` is used to count the occurrences of the dominant element in the array. We then iterate through the array and keep track of the count of the dominant element in the left half and the right half of the array. If at any point, the dominant element in the left half has more occurrences than in the right half and the count of dominant elements in the left half is more than the count of dominant elements in the right half, we have found a valid split and return the index. If no valid split is found, we return -1.\n", "Here is a Python solution that uses a prefix sum array to keep track of the dominant element in the left and right part of the array.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        dominant = max(set(nums), key=nums.count)\n        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n        suffix = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            if nums[i] == dominant:\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1]\n            if nums[n - 1 - i] == dominant:\n                suffix[n - 1 - i] = suffix[n - i] + 1\n            else:\n                suffix[n - 1 - i] = suffix[n - i]\n        for i in range(n - 1):\n            if prefix[i] > (i + 1) // 2 and suffix[i + 1] > (n - i - 1) // 2:\n                return i\n        return -1\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first find the dominant element in the array.

For each index `i`, if the dominant element in the left part of the array is more than half of the left part and the dominant element in the right part of the array is more than half of the right part, we return `i` as the minimum index of a valid split.

Finally, it returns the sum of `dp[i][(1 << n) - 1]` for all `i`, which is the number of special permutations of `nums`.\n", "Here is a Python solution using dynamic programming.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache\nfrom math import prod\n\nclass Solution:\n    def specialPerm(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        nums.sort()\n        fullmask = (1 << n) - 1\n\n        # Create a list of lists to store the valid next states for each number\n        nxt = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):\n            i = bin(mask).count('1') - 1\n            for j in range(n):\n                if ((mask >> j) & 1) or nums[i] % nums[j] != 0:\n                    continue\n                nxt[i].append(mask | (1 << j))\n\n        # Use dynamic programming to count the number of special permutations\n        @lru_cache(None)\n        def dp(i: int, mask: int) -> int:\n            if mask == fullmask:\n                return 1\n            return sum(dp(j, nmask) for nmask in nxt[i]) % MOD\n\n        return sum(dp(i, 1 << i) for i in range(n)) * prod(factorial(nums.count(x)) for x in set(nums)) % MOD\n```\n\nThe solution works by first sorting the input list of numbers. Then, it creates a list of lists `nxt` where `nxt[i]` is a list of all possible next states for the number at index `i`.\n\nThe function `dp(i, mask)` calculates the number of special permutations starting with the number at index `i` and using the numbers represented by the bitmask `mask`. The function uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nFinally, the solution calculates the total number of special permutations by summing `dp(i, 1 << i)` for all `i`, and then multiplies the result by the product of factorials of the counts of each number in the list. The result is taken modulo `10**9 + 7` to prevent overflow.\n", "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming and bitmasking. The idea is to use a 3D dp array dp[i][j][k] where i is the index of the current number, j is the bitmask of the numbers that have been used so far, and k is the modulus of the last number used. \n\nThe base case is when i is equal to the length of the array. In this case, we return 1 as we have found a valid permutation. \n\nFor each number in the array, we iterate through all the possible numbers that have not been used yet. If the current number is a multiple or a factor of the previous number, we recursively call the function with the updated bitmask and modulus. \n\nFinally, we return the sum of all the valid permutations. \n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def specialPerm(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        full_mask = (1 << n) - 1\n        dp = [[[-1]*61 for _ in range(1<<n)] for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        def solve(i, mask, prev):\n            if i == n:\n                return 1\n            if dp[i][mask][prev] != -1:\n                return dp[i][mask][prev]\n            ways = 0\n            for j in range(n):\n                if (mask & (1 << j)) == 0 and (nums[j] % nums[prev] == 0 or nums[prev] % nums[j] == 0):\n                    ways = (ways + solve(i + 1, mask | (1 << j), j)) % mod\n            dp[i][mask][prev] = ways\n            return ways\n        \n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            ans = (ans + solve(1, 1 << i, i)) % mod\n        return ans\n```\n\nIn the above code, `solve(i, mask, prev)` is a function that returns the number of special permutations of the array `nums[0..i]`, where `mask` is a bitmask indicating which numbers have been used so far, and `prev` is the index of the previous number in the permutation. The base case is when `i` is equal to the length of the array, in which case we return 1.\n\nThe function `solve(i, mask, prev)` is called recursively for each possible number that can be added to the permutation. If the current number is a multiple or a factor of the previous number, we add the number of valid permutations that can be formed by adding the current number to the permutation.\n\nFinally, the function `specialPerm(nums)` is called to return the number of special permutations of the array `nums`.\n", "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming and bitmasking.\n\nThe idea is to use a dp table dp[i][j] where i is the bitmask representing the numbers that have been used so far and j is the last number used. We initialize dp[0][0] to 1 because there is exactly one way to use no numbers and the last number is 0.\n\nThen, for each bitmask i and each number j that is not used yet, we check if j can be used as the next number in the permutation.

The space complexity is `O(n)`.\n", "This problem can be solved by simulating the movement of the robots. \n\nFirst, we can create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the initial position and direction of each robot. Then, we can sort this list based on the initial position of the robots. \n\nAfter that, we can simulate the movement of the robots for `d` seconds. If two robots collide, we change their directions. \n\nFinally, we can calculate the sum of the distances between all pairs of robots. \n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def sumDistance(self, nums: List[int], s: str, d: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        robots = sorted((x, 1 if y == 'R' else -1) for x, y in zip(nums, s))\n        n = len(robots)\n        dist = [0]*n\n        for _ in range(d):\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                if robots[i][1] == 1 and robots[i+1][1] == -1:\n                    robots[i], robots[i+1] = robots[i+1], robots[i]\n            for i in range(n):\n                robots[i] = (robots[i][0] + robots[i][1], robots[i][1])\n                dist[i] = (dist[i] + abs(robots[i][0] - nums[i])) % MOD\n        return sum(dist) % MOD\n```\n\nThis solution works by first sorting the robots based on their initial positions. Then, for each second of movement, it checks if any two robots are about to collide and swaps their directions if they are. After that, it updates the positions of all robots and calculates the distance they have travelled. Finally, it returns the sum of all these distances.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because for each second of movement, it checks all pairs of robots to see if they are about to collide. The space complexity is O(n) because it stores the positions and directions of all robots and the distances they have travelled.\n", "This problem can be solved by simulating the movement of the robots.\n\nFirst, we need to update the positions of the robots after `d` seconds. We can do this by iterating over the string `s` and updating the positions of the robots accordingly. If the robot is moving to the left, we subtract `d` from its position. If it's moving to the right, we add `d` to its position.\n\nAfter updating the positions, we need to calculate the sum of distances between all pairs of robots. We can do this by sorting the positions and then iterating over the sorted positions. For each position, we add the product of the number of robots to the left of this position and the number of robots to the right of this position (which is the total number of robots minus the number of robots to the left of this position) to the sum. We also add the product of the distance to the left of this position and the number of robots to the right of this position (which is the total distance to the left minus the distance to the left of this position) to the sum. We also add the product of the distance to the right of this position and the number of robots to the left of this position (which is the total distance to the right minus the distance to the right of this position) to the sum.\n\nFinally, we return the sum modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nHere is the Python code for this solution:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def sumDistance(self, nums: List[int], s: str, d: int) -> int:\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            if s[i] == 'L':\n                nums[i] -= d\n            else:\n                nums[i] += d\n        nums.sort()\n        n = len(nums)\n        left = [0] * n\n        right = [0] * n\n        left[0] = nums[0]\n        right[-1] = nums[-1]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            left[i] = left[i - 1] + nums[i]\n            right[n - i - 1] = right[n - i] + nums[n - i - 1]\n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            ans += i * nums[i] - left[i]\n            ans -= (n - i - 1) * nums[i] - right[i]\n            ans %= mod\n        return ans\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of `O(n log n)` due to the sorting and `O(n)` for the rest of the operations.\n", "This problem can be solved by simulating the movement of the robots. The main idea is to first update the positions of the robots according to the directions given in the string `s` and the number of seconds `d`.

The helper function takes the following parameters:\n\n- `pos`: the current position in the number.\n- `sum_digits`: the sum of the digits in the number.\n- `limit`: whether we have reached the upper limit.\n\nIn the helper function, we first check if we have reached the end of the number. If we have, we return 1 if the sum of the digits is in the range [min_sum, max_sum], else we return 0.\n\nThen, we check if we have already calculated the number of good integers for the current position, sum of digits, and limit. If we have, we return the value.\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of good integers for the current position, sum of digits, and limit. We do this by iterating over the digits in the range [0, 9] and recursively calling the helper function for the next position.\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(log(num2) * max_sum * 2) and the space complexity is O(log(num2) * max_sum * 2).\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def count(self, num1: str, num2: str, min_sum: int, max_sum: int) -> int:\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        num1, num2 = int(num1), int(num2)\n        len_num1, len_num2 = len(str(num1)), len(str(num2))\n        dp = [[[[-1]*2 for _ in range(max_sum+1)] for _ in range(40)] for _ in range(20)]\n        \n        def dfs(pos: int, sum_digits: int, limit: int) -> int:\n            if pos == -1:\n                return 1 if min_sum <= sum_digits <= max_sum else 0\n            if not limit and dp[pos][sum_digits][min_sum] != -1:\n                return dp[pos][sum_digits][min_sum]\n            up = int(num2[pos]) if limit else 9\n            res = 0\n            for d in range(up+1):\n                if d != 0 or pos != len_num2-1 or num2[pos] != '0':\n                    res += dfs(pos-1, sum_digits+d, limit and d == up)\n            if not limit:\n                dp[pos][sum_digits][min_sum] = res\n            return res % mod\n        \n        res = dfs(len_num2-1, 0, True)\n        dp = [[[-1]*2 for _ in range(max_sum+1)] for _ in range(40)]\n        return (res - dfs(len_num1-1, 0, True)) % mod\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over the digits of the numbers in reverse order.

The last element of `derived` is XORed with the first element of `original`.\n\nThe problem is asking if there exists a `original` array that could have formed `derived`. \n\nThe answer is yes, if and only if the XOR of all elements in `derived` is `0`. This is because the XOR operation is its own inverse. If `a \u2295 b = c`, then `a \u2295 c = b` and `b \u2295 c = a`. \n\nSo, if `a \u2295 b \u2295 c = 0`, then `a \u2295 b = c` and `c \u2295 c = 0`, so `a \u2295 b = 0`. \n\nSo, if the XOR of all elements in `derived` is `0`, then `derived` can be formed by XORing each element with the next element.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this logic:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def doesValidArrayExist(self, derived: List[int]) -> bool:\n        return reduce(lambda x, y: x ^ y, derived) == 0\n```\n\nThis code uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to apply the XOR operation (`^`) to all elements in `derived`. The `reduce` function applies a binary function (in this case, XOR) to all elements in an iterable in a cumulative way. The `lambda` function is an anonymous function that takes two arguments and returns their XOR.\n\nThe `== 0` at the end checks if the result of the `reduce` operation is `0`. If it is, then `derived` can be formed by XORing each element with the next element, so the function returns `True`. If it's not, then `derived` can't be formed by XORing each element with the next element, so the function returns `False`.\n", "The problem can be solved by using the concept of XOR operation. The XOR operation is commutative and associative, meaning that the order in which the operations are performed does not matter. Also, the XOR of any number with itself is 0 and the XOR of any number with 0 is the number itself.\n\nWe can start by assuming that the first element of the original array is 0. Then, we can calculate the XOR of the derived array and see if it equals to 0. If it does, then we know that the original array is valid. If it doesn't, then we can try the other possibility that the first element of the original array is 1. We can do the same calculation and see if it equals to 0. If it does, then we know that the original array is valid. If it doesn't, then we know that there is no valid original array that can form the derived array.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def doesValidArrayExist(self, derived: List[int]) -> bool:\n        return all(x==y for x,y in zip(derived,derived[1:]+derived[:1]))\n```\n\nIn this code, we are using the `zip` function to pair up the elements of the derived array with the elements of the derived array shifted by one position. Then, we are using the `all` function to check if all the pairs have the same XOR. If they do, then we know that the original array is valid. If they don't, then we know that there is no valid original array that can form the derived array.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).\n", "Here is a Python solution that uses the concept of XOR operation. \n\nThe XOR operation has the property that a ^ a = 0 for any a.

It applies a binary function (in this case, the XOR operation) to all elements of the list `derived`.

For each position, we calculate the cost to reach the target position if we use the special road and the cost to reach the target position if we don't use the special road. We add these costs to the priority queue. We continue this process until we reach the target position or the priority queue is empty.\n\nThe visited set is used to avoid revisiting the same position with the same distance. If we revisit a position with the same distance, it means we have found a shorter path to the same position, so we can ignore the longer path.\n\nThe cost of a path is the sum of the costs of all special roads used and the cost to reach the target position. The distance is the sum of the distances of all special roads used. We use these two values to avoid revisiting the same position with the same distance.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the number of special roads. The space complexity is also O(n^2) because we store all the visited positions in the visited set.\n", "This problem is a variant of the shortest path problem in a graph. The main difference is that we have some special roads that can be used any number of times. \n\nWe can solve this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a shortest path algorithm for graphs with non-negative edge weights. \n\nThe idea is to maintain a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority is the cost to reach that node. Initially, we add the start node to the queue with a cost of 0. Then, for each node we visit, we add all the nodes that we can reach from it to the queue, with the cost to reach those nodes being the cost to reach the current node plus the cost to reach those nodes from the current node. \n\nHowever, we also need to consider the special roads. For each special road, we can add a node that represents the special road to the queue, with the cost to reach that node being the cost to reach the start node plus the cost of the special road. \n\nAfter we have visited all the nodes, we return the cost to reach the target node.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python3\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCost(self, start: List[int], target: List[int], specialRoads: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        pq = [(0, start[0], start[1])]\n        visited = set()\n        while pq:\n            cost, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)\n            if [x, y] == target:\n                return cost\n            if (x, y) in visited:\n                continue\n            visited.add((x, y))\n            for x1, y1, x2, y2, c in specialRoads:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (cost + abs(x - x1) + abs(y - y1) + c, x2, y2))\n            heapq.heappush(pq, (cost + abs(x - target[0]) + abs(y - target[1]), target[0], target[1]))\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis code first initializes a priority queue with the start node and a set to keep track of visited nodes. Then it enters a loop where it pops the node with the smallest cost from the queue, checks if it is the target node, and if not, adds all the nodes that can be reached from it to the queue. Finally, it returns the cost to reach the target node.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n log n) where n is the number of nodes in the graph, because each node is added to the queue once and removed once, and each operation on the priority queue takes logarithmic time. The space complexity is O(n) because we need to store the priority queue and the set of visited nodes.\n", "Here is a Python solution using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCost(self, start: List[int], target: List[int], specialRoads: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Add the target to special roads with cost 0\n        specialRoads.append([*start, *target, 0])\n        # Initialize the distance dictionary\n        dist = {(start[0], start[1]): 0}\n        # Initialize the priority queue\n        pq = [(0, start[0], start[1])]\n        # Loop until the priority queue is empty\n        while pq:\n            d, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)\n            # If the current position is the target, return the distance\n            if (x, y) == (target[0], target[1]):\n                return d\n            # If the current distance is greater than the recorded distance, skip\n            if d != dist[(x, y)]:\n                continue\n            # Loop through all special roads\n            for x1, y1, x2, y2, cost in specialRoads:\n                # Calculate the new distance\n                new_d = d + abs(x - x1) + abs(y - y1) + cost\n                # If the new distance is less than the recorded distance, update the distance and add to the priority queue\n                if (x2, y2) not in dist or new_d < dist[(x2, y2)]:\n                    dist[(x2, y2)] = new_d\n                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_d, x2, y2))\n        # If no path is found, return -1\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis solution works by using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the target. The priority queue is used to always explore the node with the smallest distance first. The distance is calculated as the sum of the current distance, the Manhattan distance from the current position to the special road's start position, and the cost of the special road. If the new distance is less than the recorded distance, the distance is updated and the node is added to the priority queue. If the current position is the target, the distance is returned. If no path is found, -1 is returned.\n", "This problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nFirst, we add the start and target points to the special roads list, with their costs being the Manhattan distance to the target.\n\nThen, we use a priority queue to store the points we need to visit, and a dictionary to store the minimum cost to reach each point.\n\nWe start from the start point, and for each point we visit, we try to reach its neighbors using the special roads.

If we can't find a character that does not form a palindrome with its neighbors, we return an empty string.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def smallestBeautifulString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        s = list(s)\n        n = len(s)\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            j = ord(s[i]) - ord('a') + 1\n            while j < k:\n                s[i] = chr(j + ord('a'))\n                if i > 0 and s[i - 1] == s[i] or i > 1 and s[i - 2] == s[i]:\n                    j += 1\n                    continue\n                break\n            if j < k:\n                break\n        else:\n            return \"\"\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            for x in range(k):\n                s[j] = chr(x + ord('a'))\n                if j > 0 and s[j - 1] == s[j] or j > 1 and s[j - 2] == s[j]:\n                    continue\n                break\n        return \"\".join(s)\n```\n\nIn the code above, `ord(s[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is used to get the index of the current character in the alphabet, and `chr(j + ord('a'))` is used to get the character corresponding to the index in the alphabet. The condition `s[i - 1] == s[i] or s[i - 2] == s[i]` is used to check if the current character forms a palindrome with its neighbors. If it does, we increment `j` and continue to the next iteration. If it does not, we break the loop and replace the current character with the character corresponding to the index `j`.\n\nThe code then replaces the remaining characters with the smallest possible character that does not form a palindrome with its neighbors. If we can't find such a character, we return an empty string.\n\nThe time complexity of the code is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n", "Here is a Python solution that uses a greedy approach. The idea is to start from the end of the string and replace the character with the smallest possible character that is larger than the current character and does not form a palindrome with the next character. If no such character is found, we move to the previous character and repeat the process. If we reach the beginning of the string and still cannot find a suitable character, it means that there is no lexicographically larger beautiful string, so we return an empty string.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def smallestBeautifulString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        s = list(s)\n        n = len(s)\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            j = ord(s[i]) - ord('a') + 1\n            while j < k:\n                s[i] = chr(j + ord('a'))\n                if i > 0 and s[i - 1] == s[i]:\n                    continue\n                if i > 1 and s[i - 2] == s[i]:\n                    continue\n                break\n            if j < k:\n                continue\n            if i == 0:\n                return \"\"\n            s[i] = chr(j + ord('a'))\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                for c in range(k):\n                    s[j] = chr(c + ord('a'))\n                    if j > 0 and s[j - 1] == s[j]:\n                        continue\n                    if j > 1 and s[j - 2] == s[j]:\n                        continue\n                    break\n        return \"\".join(s)\n```\n\nThis solution works in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the string.

If the current character `ch` is less than or equal to `last`, we need to insert characters. The number of characters to insert is `ord(last) - ord(ch) + 1`. After that, we update `last` to `ch`.\n\nFinally, we add the number of characters needed to complete the sequence after the last character. This is `ord('c') - ord(last)`.\n\nFor example, if `word` is \"aaa\", `last` will be 'a' after the first iteration, 'b' after the second, and 'c' after the third. The number of characters needed to complete the sequence after 'c' is `ord('c') - ord('c')`, which is 0. So the total number of characters needed is 0.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of `word`.

This difference is added to the result. The ASCII value of 'a' is subtracted from the ASCII value of the last character in the string to get the number of characters that need to be inserted at the end to make the string valid.

The lengths of the integers in each column are `[3, 2, 2]`, `[2, 1, 1]`, and `[1, 2, 2]` respectively, so the final result is `[3, 2, 2]`.\n", "Here is a Python solution using list comprehension:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findColumnWidth(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        return [max(len(str(n)) for n in col) for col in zip(*grid)]\n```\n\nIn this solution, we use the `zip(*grid)` to transpose the matrix, so that we can iterate over the columns instead of the rows. For each column, we calculate the maximum length of its integers by converting each integer to a string and taking its length.\n\nThe `len(str(n))` is used to get the length of an integer, which is the number of digits in the integer. If the integer is negative, we add 1 to the length to account for the negative sign.\n\nThe `max` function is used to find the maximum length of the integers in the column.\n\nThe result is a list of the maximum lengths of the integers in each column.\n\nFor example, if `grid = [[-15,1,3],[15,7,12],[5,6,-2]]`, the transposed grid is `[(-15,15,5), (1,7,6), (3,12,-2)]`.

The space complexity is `O(n)`.\n", "This problem can be solved by using the concept of median.\n\nFirst, we need to understand that the sum of each subarray of length k is equal if and only if all elements in the subarray are equal.\n\nSo, we can find the median of each subarray of length k, and make all elements in the subarray equal to the median.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def makeSubKSumEqual(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(arr)\n        gcd = math.gcd(n, k)\n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(gcd):\n            cycle = sorted([arr[j] for j in range(i, n, gcd)])\n            median = cycle[len(cycle) // 2]\n            ans += sum(abs(num - median) for num in cycle)\n        return ans\n```\n\nIn this code, we first calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the length of the array and k. This is because the subarray of length k is equivalent to the subarray of length gcd.\n\nThen, we iterate over the array with a step of gcd. For each subarray, we sort the elements and find the median.\n\nFinally, we calculate the sum of absolute differences between each element and the median, which is the number of operations needed to make all elements in the subarray equal to the median. We add this number to the answer.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(n).\n", "This problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The idea is to group the elements in the array into groups of size `k`. For each group, we find the median of the group and make all elements in the group equal to the median.

This is because we can only make subarrays of size `k` if `k` is a divisor of the length of the array.\n\nThen, for each group of size `k`, we sort the group and find the median. We then calculate the sum of absolute differences between the elements in the group and the median, which is the number of operations required to make all elements in the group equal to the median.\n\nFinally, we return the total number of operations required to make all subarrays of size `k` equal.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the sorted group of elements.\n", "The problem is asking us to make all subarrays of length `k` equal by performing operations on the elements of the array. The operations are allowed to be done on any element of the array any number of times.\n\nThe idea is to make all elements of the array equal to the median of the array. This is because the median is the value that minimizes the sum of absolute differences to all other elements.\n\nHere is the Python solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def makeSubKSumEqual(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(arr)\n        arr = arr + arr\n        k = min(k, n)\n        res = float('inf')\n        for i in range(k):\n            target = sorted(arr[i::k])[len(arr[i::k])//2]\n            res = min(res, sum(abs(target - x) for x in arr[i::k]))\n        return res\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first extend the array by appending a copy of itself to it. This is because the array is circular, so the subarrays of length `k` can wrap around the end of the array.\n\nThen we iterate over the first `k` elements of the extended array. For each of these elements, we calculate the median of the subarray that starts at that element. This is done by sorting the subarray and taking the middle element.\n\nFinally, we calculate the sum of absolute differences between the target value and all elements in the subarray. This is the number of operations needed to make all elements in the subarray equal to the target value. We keep track of the minimum of these sums.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation in each iteration.

For each element, find the smallest prime number that is less than the current element and subtract it from the current element. If the resulting number is less than the previous element, subtract the next smallest prime number and so on. If you can't find a prime number that makes the current element less than the previous one, return False.\n\nFinally, if you can make all elements less than the previous one, return True.\n\nHere is the Python code for this approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def primeSubOperation(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        def is_prime(n):\n            if n < 2:\n                return False\n            for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n                if n % i == 0:\n                    return False\n            return True\n\n        primes = [i for i in range(2, 1000) if is_prime(i)]\n        nums.append(0)\n        for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):\n            if nums[i] < nums[i + 1]:\n                continue\n            j = bisect_right(primes, nums[i]) - 1\n            while j >= 0 and nums[i] - primes[j] >= nums[i + 1]:\n                j -= 1\n            if j < 0:\n                return False\n            nums[i] -= primes[j]\n        return True\n```\n\nIn this code, `is_prime(n)` is a helper function that checks if a number `n` is prime. `primes` is a list of all prime numbers less than 1000. `bisect_right(primes, nums[i]) - 1` is a binary search that finds the index of the largest prime number that is less than `nums[i]`. If `nums[i] - primes[j]` is still greater than or equal to `nums[i + 1]`, it means we can't find a prime number that makes `nums[i]` less than `nums[i + 1]`, so we return False.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.\n"], "input_token_count": 567, "output_token_counts": [501, 598, 571, 582, 588], "total_token_counts": [1068, 1165, 1138, 1149, 1155], "thinking_time": [92.0, 126.0, 91.0, 157.0, 128.0], "average_thinking_time": 115.33333333333333, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "pass_rate": 0.0}

It uses dynamic programming to store the number of beautiful subsets for each subset. The time complexity is O(2^n) where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is also O(2^n) because we need to store the number of beautiful subsets for each subset.\n", "This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) approach.

If it is not, we can include it and continue the DFS.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def beautifulSubsets(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        self.res = 0\n        self.dfs(nums, k, 0, [])\n        return self.res - 1  # subtract 1 for empty subset\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, k, start, path):\n        self.res += 1\n        for i in range(start, len(nums)):\n            if path and nums[i] - path[-1] == k:\n                continue\n            self.dfs(nums, k, i + 1, path + [nums[i]])\n```\n\nIn the above code, `self.res` is used to count the number of beautiful subsets. The `dfs` function is a helper function that performs the depth-first search. It starts from the `start` index and iterates through the array. If the difference between the current number and the last number in the path is equal to `k`, it skips the current number. Otherwise, it includes the current number in the path and continues the DFS.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n*2^n) where n is the length of the array. This is because for each number, we have two choices: include it or not. So, the total number of subsets is 2^n. For each subset, we need to check if it is beautiful, which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n*2^n).\n\nThe space complexity is O(n) because the maximum depth of the recursion is n (when all numbers are included in the path).\n", "Here is a Python solution using a depth-first search approach.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def beautifulSubsets(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        self.res = 0\n        self.dfs(nums, k, 0, [])\n        return self.res - 1  # subtract 1 to exclude the empty subset\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, k, start, path):\n        self.res += 1\n        for i in range(start, len(nums)):\n            if path and nums[i] - path[-1] == k:\n                continue\n            self.dfs(nums, k, i + 1, path + [nums[i]])\n```\n\nThis solution works by sorting the input array. Then, it uses a depth-first search to generate all possible subsets. For each subset, it checks if the absolute difference between the last element of the subset and the current element is equal to `k`. If it is, the current element is skipped. Otherwise, the current element is added to the subset and the search continues. The number of subsets is incremented at each step. The final result is the number of subsets minus 1 to exclude the empty subset.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n * 2^n) where n is the length of the input array.

The `dfs` function is a recursive function that takes two parameters: `idx` and `subset`. `idx` is the current index in `nums`, and `subset` is the current subset of numbers.\n\nThe base case for the recursion is when `idx` equals the length of `nums`, which means we have processed all the numbers in `nums`. In this case, we increment `self.res` by 1 and return.\n\nIn the recursive case, we first check if the current number `nums[idx]` can be added to the subset without violating the condition.

If the current bit is '1', it checks if the next bit is also '1'. If it is, it adds 1 to the count of operations. Otherwise, it adds 2 to the count of operations. This is because adding a power of 2 to a number with a '1' bit in that position will result in a '0' bit, and subtracting a power of 2 from a number with a '1' bit in that position will result in a '0' bit. Therefore, it is always optimal to add or subtract a power of 2 from a '1' bit.\n\nFor example, for `n = 54`, the binary representation is `110110`. The operations would be:\n\n- Add 2^5 = 32 to n, so n becomes 96 (`1100000`).\n- Add 2^4 = 16 to n, so n becomes 112 (`1110000`).\n- Subtract 2^6 = 64 from n, so n becomes 0 (`0000000`).\n\nSo the minimum number of operations is 3.\n", "The problem is asking to find the minimum number of operations needed to reduce a positive integer `n` to 0. In each operation, we can either add or subtract a power of 2 from `n`.\n\nThe key observation is that the binary representation of `n` can be used to find the minimum number of operations. \n\nIf `n` is a power of 2, then the minimum number of operations is 1 (just subtract `n`). If `n` is not a power of 2, then the minimum number of operations is 2. This is because we can add or subtract a power of 2 from `n` to make it a power of 2, and then subtract that power of 2 to make `n` equal to 0.\n\nHere is a Python solution that uses bit manipulation to solve the problem:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n        if n & (n - 1) == 0:  # n is a power of 2\n            return 1\n        else:\n            return 2\n```\n\nIn this solution, `n & (n - 1)` checks if `n` is a power of 2. If `n` is a power of 2, then `n & (n - 1)` is 0. Otherwise, `n & (n - 1)` is not 0.\n\nThis solution works because the binary representation of a power of 2 contains exactly one bit set to 1. For example, the binary representation of 8 is 1000, and the binary representation of 7 is 0111. When we subtract 1 from a power of 2, all the bits to the right of the rightmost bit set to 1 become 1, and the bit set to 1 becomes 0. Therefore, `n & (n - 1)` is 0 for a power of 2, and is not 0 for a non-power of 2.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), and the space complexity is O(1).\n", "Here is a Python solution using bit manipulation. The idea is to find the minimum number of operations to make n equal to 0. We can do this by checking each bit of n from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.

Then we count the number of '1's in the binary representation of n. The number of '1's is the number of operations we need to make n equal to 0.\n\nFor example, if n = 39, the binary representation of 39 is '100111'. There are 4 '1's in the binary representation, so we need 4 operations to make 39 equal to 0.\n\nTime complexity is O(log n) because we need to check each bit of n.

We can add or subtract a power of 2 by changing the corresponding bit in the binary representation. Therefore, the minimum number of operations is the sum of the number of 1s and 0s in the binary representation minus 1.\n\nFor example, if n = 39 = 100111 in binary, we can make n equal to 0 with 3 operations:\n\n1.

Finally, we return the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers as integers.\n\nThis solution works because it ensures that the maximum number is as large as possible by replacing the first non-9 digit with 9 and the minimum number is as small as possible by replacing the first digit with 0 (except for the first digit, which we replace with 1 to avoid leading zeroes).\n", "Here is a Python solution that uses string manipulation to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minMaxDifference(self, num: int) -> int:\n        num_str = str(num)\n        max_num = min_num = num_str\n        for i in range(10):\n            max_num = max_num.replace(str(i), '9')\n            min_num = min_num.replace(str(i), '0' if i != 1 else '1')\n        return int(max_num) - int(min_num)\n```\n\nThis solution works by first converting the number to a string.

The first thing to notice is that the operations on `nums1` are independent of the operations on `nums2`. This means that we can perform all the operations on `nums1` first, and then apply the operations on `nums2`.\n\nThe second thing to notice is that the operations on `nums1` are very simple: they just flip the bits from `0` to `1` and from `1` to `0`. This can be done using a simple XOR operation.\n\nThe operations on `nums2` are more complex. We can use a prefix sum array to keep track of the sum of the elements in `nums2`.

Then, for each query, if the query is of type 1, it flips the bits in `nums1` from `l` to `r`. If the query is of type 2, it updates `nums2` and recomputes the prefix sum array. If the query is of type 3, it returns the last element in the prefix sum array.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` for the initial computation of the prefix sum array, and `O(n)` for each query, where `n` is the length of `nums1`. The space complexity is `O(n)` for the prefix sum array.\n", "This problem can be solved using a combination of Segment Tree and Binary Indexed Tree (BIT). \n\nFirst, we need to understand the problem.

If they are, it means there is only one element left in the array, so it adds this element to `concat_val`. If they are not equal, it concatenates the first and last elements of the array, converts the result to an integer, and adds it to `concat_val`.\n\nFinally, the function returns `concat_val`, which is the concatenation value of the array.\n", "Here is a Python solution that uses two pointers to find the concatenation value.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findTheArrayConcVal(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        concat_val = 0\n        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n        while left <= right:\n            if left == right:\n                concat_val += nums[left]\n            else:\n                concat_val += int(str(nums[left]) + str(nums[right]))\n            left += 1\n            right -= 1\n        return concat_val\n```\n\nIn this solution, we initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning and end of the `nums` list respectively. We then enter a loop where we keep concatenating the first and last elements of the list until `left` is greater than `right`. If `left` and `right` are equal, we simply add the single element to the `concat_val`. If they are not equal, we concatenate the two elements and convert the resulting string to an integer before adding it to `concat_val`.

If `left` and `right` are equal, it means we have an odd number of elements, so we just add the middle element to `concat_val`. Otherwise, we concatenate the first and last elements, convert the result to an integer, and add it to `concat_val`.

Therefore, the number of distinct numbers that will be on the board is the number of coprime numbers to `n`. \n\nThe number of coprime numbers to `n` is given by Euler's totient function \u03c6(n), which is defined as the number of integers `k` in the range 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n that are coprime to `n`. \n\nWe can calculate \u03c6(n) using the formula: \n\n\u03c6(n) = n * \u220f(1 - 1/p) for all prime factors p of n\n\nWe can calculate this using the Python built-in `math.gcd()` function to calculate the greatest common divisor, and then use a loop to calculate the product. \n\nHere is the Python code that implements this:\n\n```python3\nimport math\nclass Solution:\n    def distinctIntegers(self, n: int) -> int:\n        # If n is 1, return 1 because there is only one distinct number on the board\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        # Otherwise, calculate the number of distinct numbers using Euler's totient function\n        else:\n            result = n\n            for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n                if n % i == 0:\n                    while n % i == 0:\n                        n /= i\n                    result -= result / i\n            if n > 1:\n                result -= result / n\n            return int(result)\n```\n\nThis code first checks if `n` is 1, in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of distinct numbers using the Euler's totient function. It does this by looping over all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, and if `n` is divisible by the current number, it divides `n` by that number until it is no longer divisible. It then subtracts the result of `result / i` from `result`. If `n` is still greater than 1 after this, it subtracts `result / n` from `result`. Finally, it returns `result` as the number of distinct numbers on the board.\n", "The problem is asking to find the number of distinct integers that will be on the board after 10^9 days. The integers are added to the board based on the modulo operation with the current integers on the board. \n\nThe modulo operation is a common operation in number theory, and it gives the remainder of a division operation. For example, 5 % 2 equals 1 because 5 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to realize that the modulo operation is cyclical. That is, for any integer `i` and `n`, `i % n` will always be a number between 0 and `n-1`. \n\nTherefore, for any integer `n`, the integers `1` to `n-1` will be added to the board after 10^9 days. \n\nHere is a Python solution that uses this logic:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def distinctIntegers(self, n: int) -> int:\n        # If n is 1, there is only one distinct integer on the board\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        # Otherwise, return n-1\n        else:\n            return n-1\n```\n\nThis solution works because the modulo operation is cyclical, and for any integer `n`, the integers `1` to `n-1` will be added to the board after 10^9 days.\n"], "input_token_count": 492, "output_token_counts": [290, 268, 236, 655, 327], "total_token_counts": [782, 760, 728, 1147, 819], "thinking_time": [136.0, 95.0, 80.0, 73.0, 47.0], "average_thinking_time": 82.66666666666667, "results": [true, false, false, false, true], "pass_rate": 0.4}

For each digit, it multiplies the digit by the current sign (which alternates between 1 and -1) and adds it to the total. The sign is then flipped for the next iteration.\n\nThe `while` loop continues until all digits have been processed. The final total is then returned.\n\nThe sign is initially 1, so the most significant digit is added. The sign is then flipped to -1 for the next digit, and so on, alternating between positive and negative for each digit.\n\nThe `n //= 10` operation is integer division, which discards the remainder and rounds down to the nearest whole number. This effectively removes the last digit from `n` for the next iteration.\n\nThe `-sign * total` at the end is necessary because the last digit processed is not negated, so its sign needs to be flipped.\n\nFor example, if `n` is 521, the process goes as follows:\n\n* `total` is 0, `n` is 521, `sign` is 1. `total` becomes 5, `n` becomes 52, `sign` becomes -1.\n* `total` is 5, `n` is 52, `sign` is -1. `total` becomes 3, `n` becomes 5, `sign` becomes 1.\n* `total` is 3, `n` is 5, `sign` is 1. `total` becomes 8, `n` becomes 0, `sign` becomes -1.\n* `n` is 0, so the loop ends.\n* The final result is `-8`.\n", "Here is a Python solution using a while loop to iterate through the digits of the number. The sign of each digit is determined by the parity of its position (0-indexed from the right).\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def alternateDigitSum(self, n: int) -> int:\n        n = str(n)\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(len(n)):\n            if i % 2 == 0:  # if the position is even\n                total += int(n[i])  # add the digit\n            else:  # if the position is odd\n                total -= int(n[i])  # subtract the digit\n        return total\n```\n\nThis solution works by converting the integer to a string, then iterating through the string. For each digit, it checks if its position is even or odd. If it's even, it adds the digit to the total. If it's odd, it subtracts the digit from the total. The final total is returned.\n\nFor example, if n = 521, the string representation is \"521\". The first digit \"5\" is at position 0, so it's added to the total. The second digit \"2\" is at position 1, so it's subtracted from the total. The third digit \"1\" is at position 2, so it's added to the total. The final total is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.\n", "Here is a Python solution that uses a simple loop to iterate through the digits of the number and alternately adds and subtracts them.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def alternateDigitSum(self, n: int) -> int:\n        n = str(n)\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(len(n)):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                total += int(n[i])\n            else:\n                total -= int(n[i])\n        return total\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first convert the integer to a string so that we can iterate through its digits. We then initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the sum of the digits. We iterate through the string, and if the index of the digit is even (i.e., it's an odd-numbered digit from the right), we add the digit to `total`. If the index is odd (i.e., it's an even-numbered digit from the right), we subtract the digit from `total`. Finally, we return `total`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(d) where d is the number of digits in the number, and a space complexity of O(d) as well, because we need to store the digits of the number as a string.\n", "Here is a Python solution using a while loop to iterate through the digits of the number and a boolean flag to alternate the sign of the digits:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def alternateDigitSum(self, n: int) -> int:\n        n = str(n)\n        total = 0\n        sign = True\n        for i in n:\n            if sign:\n                total += int(i)\n                sign = False\n            else:\n                total -= int(i)\n                sign = True\n        return total\n```\n\nIn this solution, the `n` is converted to a string so that we can iterate through its digits. The `total` variable is used to keep track of the sum of the digits with their corresponding signs. The `sign` variable is a boolean flag that alternates between `True` and `False` to determine the sign of the digits. If the flag is `True`, the digit is added to the total, and if it is `False`, the digit is subtracted from the total.\n\nFor example, if `n = 521`, the digits are `5`, `2`, and `1`. The first digit `5` is added to the total, the second digit `2` is subtracted from the total, and the third digit `1` is added to the total. The final total is `4`.\n", "Here is a Python solution that uses a while loop to iterate through the digits of the number.

It then iterates through each digit in the string. If the current digit is supposed to be positive, it adds the digit to the total. If it is supposed to be negative, it subtracts the digit from the total. It then flips the boolean variable to indicate that the next digit should be the opposite sign. Finally, it returns the total.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(d) where d is the number of digits in the number.
