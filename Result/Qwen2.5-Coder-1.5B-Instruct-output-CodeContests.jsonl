This is initially set to `n - m + 2`.\n   - It then iterates over all possible starting positions of `b` in `a` and checks if the first `m` characters of `b` match the corresponding prefix of `a`.\n   - If they match, it calculates the remaining characters that need to be changed in `a` to match the rest of `b` and updates the total changes needed accordingly.\n6. **Append Result**: The result for each `k` is appended to the `result` list.\n7. **Print Output**: Finally, the script prints the results for each `k`.\n\nThis script efficiently finds the minimum number of changes required to match any number of occurrences of `b` in `a`.", "```python\ndef count_changes(a, b):\n    def count_substrings(s, sub):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(s) - len(sub) + 1):\n            if s[i:i+len(sub)] == sub:\n                count += 1\n        return count\n    \n    min_changes = float('inf')\n    \n    for k in range(n - m + 1):\n        current_changes = abs(count_substrings(a, b) - k)\n        if current_changes < min_changes:\n            min_changes = current_changes\n    \n    return [min_changes] * (n - m + 2)\n\n# Read input\ninput_line = input().strip()\nparts = input_line.split()\n\nn = int(parts[0])\nm = int(parts[1])\na = input().strip()\nb = input().strip()\n\n# Output result\nprint(*count_changes(a, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function `count_substrings`**: This function counts how many times the substring `sub` appears in the string `s`.\n2. **Main Function `count_changes`**:\n   - It initializes `min_changes` to infinity.\n   - It iterates over all possible values of `k` (from 0 to `n - m`).\n   - For each `k`, it calculates the absolute difference between the number of occurrences of `b` in `a` and `k`.\n   - If this difference is less than `min_changes`, it updates `min_changes`.\n   - Finally, it returns a list of `n - m + 2` elements where each element represents the minimum number of changes needed for each possible `k`.\n\nThis solution ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of changes required to achieve the desired number of occurrences of `b` in `a`."], "input_token_count": 477, "output_token_counts": [451, 376, 297, 578, 371], "total_token_counts": [928, 853, 774, 1055, 848], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false]}

Then, for each direction (`dx` and `dy`) from `-r` to `r`, and for each color, we update the count based on the previous counts.\n\n4. **Calculating Valid Color Combinations**: After filling the DP table, we iterate through all possible starting points of the sub-rectangles and calculate the total number of valid color combinations.

This is because the pattern must repeat itself in both dimensions.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Possible Patterns**: Since the sub-rectangles have the same pattern, we only need to consider the pattern of the sub-rectangle \\((a_x, a_y)\\). This means we can fix the pattern of the sub-rectangle and then count the number of ways to color the rest of the grid.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we need to take the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nHere's the complete Python script implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_color_combinations(n, m, k, r, c, ax, ay, bx, by):\n    # Calculate the number of ways to color the sub-rectangle (ax, ay) to (bx, by)\n    def count_sub_rectangle_colors(ax, ay, bx, by, mod):\n        # Base case: if the sub-rectangle is empty, there's exactly one way to color it\n        if bx < ax or by < ay:\n            return 1\n        # If the sub-rectangle has only one cell, there's exactly one way to color it\n        if bx == ax and by == ay:\n            return k\n        # Use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to color the sub-rectangle\n        dp = [[0] * k for _ in range(bx - ax + 1)]\n        dp[0][0] = 1\n        for i in range(1, bx - ax + 1):\n            for j in range(k):\n                for d in range(j + 1, k):\n                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][d]) % mod\n        return dp[bx - ax][k - 1]\n    \n    # Calculate the number of ways to color the entire grid\n    total_ways = count_sub_rectangle_colors(ax, ay, bx, by, MOD)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of ways to color the remaining part of the grid\n    remaining_width = max(0, bx - ax - r + 1)\n    remaining_height = max(0, by - ay - c + 1)\n    remaining_ways = count_sub_rectangle_colors(ax + r - 1, ay + c - 1, ax + remaining_width - 1, ay + remaining_height - 1, MOD)\n    \n    # Total number of valid color combinations\n    result = (total_ways * remaining_ways) % MOD\n    \n    return result\n\n# Read input\nn, m, k, r, c = map(int, input().split())\nax, ay, bx, by = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Output the result\nprint(count_color_combinations(n, m, k, r, c, ax, ay, bx, by))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sub-Rectangle Coloring Function**: `count_sub_rectangle_colors` calculates the number of ways to color a sub-rectangle of size \\(r \\times c\\) starting at position \\((ax, ay)\\).\n2. **Total Ways Calculation**: The total number of ways to color the entire grid is the product of the number of ways to color the sub-rectangle \\((ax, ay)\\) and the number of ways to color the remaining part of the grid.\n3. **Result Modulo Operation**: Finally, the result is taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to ensure it fits within the required constraints.\n\nThis script efficiently computes the number of possible batik color combinations based on the given conditions.", "```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_batik_colors(n, m, k, r, c, ax, ay, bx, by):\n    # Calculate the total number of valid sub-rectangles\n    total_sub_rectangles = (n - r + 1) * (m - c + 1)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of valid patterns for the first sub-rectangle\n    pattern_count = Counter()\n    for i in range(r):\n        for j in range(c):\n            pattern_count[tuple(grid[ay + i][ax + j])] += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of valid patterns for the second sub-rectangle\n    for i in range(r):\n        for j in range(c):\n            if (ax + i, ay + j) not in pattern_count:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                pattern_count[(ax + i, ay + j)] -= 1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of valid combinations of patterns\n    valid_combinations = 1\n    for count in pattern_count.values():\n        valid_combinations *= count\n    \n    # Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7\n    return valid_combinations % (10**9 + 7)\n\n# Read input\ninput_data = list(map(int, input().split()))\nn, m, k, r, c = input_data[:5]\ngrid = [list(input().split()) for _ in range(n)]\nax, ay, bx, by = input_data[5:]\n\n# Count the number of possible batik color combinations\nresult = count_batik_colors(n, m, k, r, c, ax, ay, bx, by)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `count_batik_colors` that calculates the number of possible batik color combinations based on the given input.

{"id": "code_contests/14", "prompt": "# Shifting Sort\n\nThe new generation external memory contains an array of integers a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nThis type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element. Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts.

Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. \n\n\n\nAn already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 \u00d7 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.\n\n<image>\n\nYou are given a description of a checkered field of size n \u00d7 m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d \u2265 k for all the ticks).\n\nDetermine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d \u2265 k or not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number test cases.\n\nThe following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 19) \u2014 the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2 3 1\n*.*\n...\n4 9 2\n*.*.*...*\n.*.*...*.\n..*.*.*..\n.....*...\n4 4 1\n*.*.\n****\n.**.\n....\n5 5 1\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n5 5 2\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n4 7 1\n*.....*\n.....*.\n..*.*..\n...*...\n3 3 1\n***\n***\n***\n3 5 1\n*...*\n.***.\n.**..\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.\n\nThe second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \\color{blue}{blue}, \\color{red}{red} and \\color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  \n---  \n*\\color{blue}{*}**  \n.\\color{green}{*}\\color{red}{*}.  \n....  \n  \nThe field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \\color{blue}{blue} and \\color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  \n---  \n*...*  \n.*.*.  \n..\\color{red}{*}.*  \n...\\color{blue}{*}.  \n  \nThe field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.\n\nThe field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).\n\nIn the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/17", "prompt": "# Array Optimization by Deque\n\nIn fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nYou are given an integer array a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j. For example, the array d = [5, 3, 7, 5] has exactly two inversions \u2014 (1, 2) and (3, 4), since d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2 and d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 array size. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after executing the described algorithm.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n4\n3 7 5 5\n3\n3 2 1\n3\n3 1 2\n4\n-1 2 2 -1\n4\n4 5 1 3\n5\n1 3 1 3 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n0\n1\n0\n1\n2\n\nNote\n\nOne of the ways to get the sequence [5, 3, 7, 5] in the deque, containing only two inversions, from the initial array [3, 7, 5, 5] (the first sample test case) is described in the problem statement. \n\nAlso, in this example, you could get the answer of two inversions by simply putting each element of the original array at the end of the deque. In this case, the original sequence [3, 7, 5, 5], also containing exactly two inversions, will be in the deque as-is.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Then, we check if each number appears exactly \\( m \\) times in the list of maximum values.\n4. **Counting Valid Permutations**: If both conditions are met, we increment the count of valid permutations.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Finally, we return the count modulo \\( p \\).\n\nThis script efficiently counts the number of valid permutations while handling large inputs.", "```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_good_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    # Calculate the number of ways to choose k good numbers out of n\n    good_numbers_count = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    \n    # If k is greater than the number of good numbers, return 0\n    if k > good_numbers_count:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Initialize the result\n    result = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible starting position for the subsegment\n    for i in range(n - m + 1):\n        # Count the frequency of each number in the current subsegment\n        segment_counts = Counter()\n        for j in range(i, i + m):\n            segment_counts[c[j]] += 1\n        \n        # Calculate the number of different maxima in the current subsegment\n        num_maxima = len(segment_counts)\n        \n        # Add the number of valid permutations to the result\n        result = (result + segment_counts[num_maxima]) % p\n    \n    return result\n\n# Read input\nn, m, k, p = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Print the result\nprint(count_good_permutations(n, m, k, p))\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose `k` good numbers out of `n` using the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\).\n\n2. If `k` is greater than the number of good numbers, return 0 because it's impossible to have more good numbers than available.\n\n3. Initialize the result to 0.\n\n4. Iterate over each possible starting position for the subsegment. For each starting position `i`, count the frequency of each number in the current subsegment using a dictionary.\n\n5. Calculate the number of different maxima in the current subsegment by counting the keys in the dictionary.\n\n6. Add the number of valid permutations to the result. A valid permutation is one where there are exactly `num_maxima` different maximums in the subsegment.\n\n7.

{"id": "code_contests/24", "prompt": "# Railway Construction\n\nBecause the railway system in Gensokyo is often congested, as an enthusiastic engineer, Kawasiro Nitori plans to construct more railway to ease the congestion.\n\nThere are n stations numbered from 1 to n and m two-way railways in Gensokyo. Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length d. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways.\n\nBecause of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station.\n\nDue to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th event will add additional amount of x_i to the cost of building a new railway from the station k_i.\n\nTo save resources, before all incidents and after each incident, Nitori wants you to help her calculate the minimal cost of railway construction.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 q \u2264 2\u22c510^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers w_1,w_2,\u2026,w_n (1 \u2264 w_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, d (1 \u2264 u,v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^9), denoting a two-way railway connecting station u and station v, with length d.\n\nThe i-th of the next q lines contains two integers k_i,x_i (1 \u2264 k_i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 x_i \u2264 4 \u00d7 10^8).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q+1 lines, and the i-th of these lines contains one integer, denoting the minimal cost of railway construction after the i-1-th incident (especially, the 0-th incident means no incident occurred).\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 4 1\n3 5 1\n4 5 1\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n9\n\n\nInput\n\n\n8 11 0\n14 4 16 15 1 3 1 14\n4 2 1\n1 2 3\n7 5 4\n2 3 1\n8 6 2\n8 5 5\n5 4 5\n7 6 7\n3 5 5\n1 6 6\n8 1 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n46\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10 16 8\n29 1 75 73 51 69 24 17 1 97\n1 2 18\n2 3 254\n2 4 546\n2 5 789\n5 6 998\n6 7 233\n7 8 433\n1 9 248\n5 10 488\n2 6 1787\n10 8 1176\n3 8 2199\n4 8 1907\n2 10 1277\n4 10 731\n9 10 1047\n1 11\n1 9\n8 8\n1 3\n2 19\n9 5\n9 4\n7 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n34\n45\n54\n54\n57\n76\n96\n112\n112\n\nNote\n\nIn the second example, Nitori can build railways as follows: 1 \u2192 2, 1 \u2192 3, 1 \u2192 4, 2 \u2192 8, and the cost is 14 + 14 + 14 + 4 = 46.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Note that you can exit the grid from any leftmost empty cell (cell in the first column) by going left, and from any topmost empty cell (cell in the first row) by going up.\n\nLet's call a grid determinable if, given only which cells are exitable, we can exactly determine which cells are filled in and which aren't.\n\nYou are given a grid a of dimensions n \u00d7 m , i. e. a grid with n rows and m columns.

Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries.\n\nA query consists of an array a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n of integers between 1 and n. a is not required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of a and p, meaning that he will compute an array s where s_j = p_j + a_j for all j = 1, 2, \u2026, n. Then, he will find the smallest index k such that s_k occurs more than once in s, and answer with k. If there is no such index k, then he will answer with 0.\n\nYou can perform at most 2n queries. Figure out the meaning of life p.\n\nInteraction\n\nStart the interaction by reading single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the permutation p.\n\nYou can then make queries. A query consists of a single line \"? \\enspace a_1 \\enspace a_2 \\enspace \u2026 \\enspace a_n\" (1 \u2264 a_j \u2264 n).\n\nThe answer to each query will be a single integer k as described above (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n).\n\nAfter making a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n  * System.out.flush() in Java;\n  * flush(output) in Pascal;\n  * stdout.flush() in Python;\n  * see documentation for other languages.\n\n\n\nTo output your answer, print a single line \"! \\enspace p_1 \\enspace p_2 \\enspace \u2026 \\enspace p_n\" then terminate.\n\nYou can make at most 2n queries. Outputting the answer does not count as a query.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, first output a line containing n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100), then output another line containing the hidden permutation p_1, p_2, \u2026, p_n of numbers from 1 to n.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n? 4 4 2 3 2\n\n? 3 5 1 5 5\n\n? 5 2 4 3 1\n\n! 3 2 1 5 4\n\nNote\n\nIn the sample, the hidden permutation p is [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]. Three queries were made.\n\nThe first query is a = [4, 4, 2, 3, 2]. This yields s = [3 + 4, 2 + 4, 1 + 2, 5 + 3, 4 + 2] = [7, 6, 3, 8, 6]. 6 is the only number that appears more than once, and it appears first at index 2, making the answer to the query 2.\n\nThe second query is a = [3, 5, 1, 5, 5]. This yields s = [3 + 3, 2 + 5, 1 + 1, 5 + 5, 4 + 5] = [6, 7, 2, 10, 9]. There are no numbers that appear more than once here, so the answer to the query is 0.\n\nThe third query is a = [5, 2, 4, 3, 1]. This yields s = [3 + 5, 2 + 2, 1 + 4, 5 + 3, 4 + 1] = [8, 4, 5, 8, 5]. 5 and 8 both occur more than once here. 5 first appears at index 3, while 8 first appears at index 1, and 1 < 3, making the answer to the query 1.\n\nNote that the sample is only meant to provide an example of how the interaction works; it is not guaranteed that the above queries represent a correct strategy with which to determine the answer.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

You are given a connected undirected graph of n nodes with m edges. You also have q queries. Each query consists of two nodes a and b.\n\nInitially, all edges in the graph have a weight of 0. For each query, you must choose a simple path starting from a and ending at b. Then you add 1 to every edge along this path. Determine if it's possible, after processing all q queries, for all edges in this graph to have an even weight. If so, output the choice of paths for each query. \n\nIf it is not possible, determine the smallest number of extra queries you could add to make it possible. It can be shown that this number will not exceed 10^{18} under the given constraints.\n\nA simple path is defined as any path that does not visit a node more than once.\n\nAn edge is said to have an even weight if its value is divisible by 2.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5, n-1 \u2264 m \u2264 min{\\left((n(n-1))/(2), 3 \u22c5 10^5\\right)}).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n, x\u2260 y) indicating an undirected edge between node x and y. The input will not contain self-loops or duplicate edges, and the provided graph will be connected.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nEach of the next q lines contains two integers a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n, a \u2260 b), the description of each query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that nq \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nIf it is possible to force all edge weights to be even, print \"YES\" on the first line, followed by 2q lines indicating the choice of path for each query in the same order the queries are given. For each query, the first line should contain a single integer x: the number of nodes in the chosen path. The next line should then contain x spaced separated integers p_i indicating the path you take (p_1 = a, p_x = b and all numbers should fall between 1 and n). This path cannot contain duplicate nodes and must be a valid simple path in the graph.\n\nIf it is impossible to force all edge weights to be even, print \"NO\" on the first line and the minimum number of added queries on the second line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n6 7\n2 1\n2 3\n3 5\n1 4\n6 1\n5 6\n4 5\n3\n1 4\n5 1\n4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\n2\n1 4\n4\n5 3 2 1\n5\n4 1 2 3 5\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 7\n4 3\n4 5\n2 1\n1 4\n1 3\n3 5\n3 2\n4\n4 2\n3 5\n5 1\n4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\n2\n\nNote\n\nHere is what the queries look like for the first test case (red corresponds to the 1st query, blue 2nd query, and green 3rd query): \n\n<image> Notice that every edge in the graph is part of either 0 or 2 colored query edges.\n\nThe graph in the second test case looks like this: \n\n<image> There does not exist an assignment of paths that will force all edges to have even weights with the given queries.

Unfortunately, he doesn't know when he needs to complete the tasks.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Time travel will now happen according to the following rules:\n\n  * For each k = 1, 2, \u2026, n, Okabe will realize at time b_k that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k (a_k < b_k). \n\n  * When he realizes this, if k-th task was already completed at time a_k, Okabe keeps the usual flow of time. Otherwise, he time travels to time a_k then immediately completes the task.\n\n  * If Okabe time travels to time a_k, all tasks completed after this time will become incomplete again. That is, for every j, if a_j>a_k, the j-th task will become incomplete, if it was complete (if it was incomplete, nothing will change).\n\n  * Okabe has bad memory, so he can time travel to time a_k only immediately after getting to time b_k and learning that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k. That is, even if Okabe already had to perform k-th task before, he wouldn't remember it before stumbling on the info about this task at time b_k again.\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the notes for an example of time travelling.\n\nThere is a certain set s of tasks such that the first moment that all of the tasks in s are simultaneously completed (regardless of whether any other tasks are currently completed), a funny scene will take place. Omkar loves this scene and wants to know how many times Okabe will time travel before this scene takes place. Find this number modulo 10^9 + 7. It can be proven that eventually all n tasks will be completed and so the answer always exists.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of tasks that Okabe needs to complete.\n\nn lines follow. The k-th of these lines contain two integers a_k and b_k (1 \u2264 a_k < b_k \u2264 2n) \u2014 the time at which Okabe needs to complete the k-th task and the time that he realizes this respectively. All 2n of these times are distinct (so every time from 1 to 2n inclusive appears exactly once in the input).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 n) \u2014 the size of the set s of tasks that lead to the funny scene.\n\nThe last line contains t integers s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_t \u2014 (1 \u2264 s_k \u2264 n, the numbers s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_t are distinct) \u2014 the set s of tasks.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the number of times that Okabe time travels until all tasks in the set s are simultaneously completed, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n2\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1 2\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n10 12\n3 7\n4 6\n2 9\n5 8\n1 11\n3\n2 4 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n17\n\n\nInput\n\n\n16\n31 32\n3 26\n17 19\n4 24\n1 28\n15 21\n12 16\n18 29\n20 23\n7 8\n11 14\n9 22\n6 30\n5 10\n25 27\n2 13\n6\n3 8 2 5 12 11\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n138\n\nNote\n\nFor the first sample, all tasks need to be completed in order for the funny scene to occur.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Nothing happens until time 3, when Okabe realizes that he should have done the 2-nd task at time 2. He then time travels to time 2 and completes the task.\n\nAs the task is done now, he does not time travel again when the time is again 3. However, at time 4, he travels to time 1 to complete the 1-st task.\n\nThis undoes the 2-nd task. This means that the 2-nd task is not currently completed, meaning that the funny scene will not occur at this point even though the 1-st task is currently completed and Okabe had previously completed the 2-nd task.\n\nOnce it is again time 3 he travels back to time 2 once more and does the 2-nd task again.\n\nNow all tasks are complete, with Okabe having time travelled 3 times.\n\nThe second sample has the same tasks for Okabe to complete. However, this time the funny scene only needs the first task to be completed in order to occur. From reading the above sample you can see that this occurs once Okabe has time travelled 2 times.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

This helps in efficiently managing the order of tasks.\n4. **Tracking Current Tasks**: We use a dictionary `current_tasks` to keep track of the tasks that are currently being processed.\n5. **Processing Tasks**: For each task, we add tasks that were completed before this one to the priority queue. Then, we add the new task to the priority queue. Finally, we check if all tasks in the set are completed and update the count of time travels accordingly.\n6. **Modulo Operation**: After processing all tasks, we return the count of time travels modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis script ensures that the time travel process is correctly simulated and the final answer is computed efficiently.", "```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    tasks = []\n    \n    # Read tasks\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks.append((a, b))\n    \n    # Sort tasks based on start time\n    tasks.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize variables\n    current_time = 0\n    travel_count = 0\n    tasks_completed = set()\n    \n    # Process tasks\n    for start, end in tasks:\n        while current_time < start:\n            current_time += 1\n            travel_count += 1\n        \n        if current_time == start:\n            tasks_completed.add(start)\n        \n        while current_time < end:\n            current_time += 1\n            \n            if current_time in tasks_completed:\n                continue\n            \n            tasks_completed.add(current_time)\n            travel_count += 1\n    \n    print(travel_count % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of tasks `n` and then each task's start and end times.\n2. **Sorting Tasks**: We sort the tasks based on their start times to process them sequentially.\n3. **Tracking Current Time and Travel Count**: We use a variable `current_time` to keep track of the current time and `travel_count` to count the number of times Okabe time travels.\n4. **Processing Tasks**: \n   - We move forward in time until we reach the start time of the current task.\n   - Once we reach the start time, we add it to the `tasks_completed` set.\n   - Then, we move forward in time until we reach the end time of the current task.\n   - During this time, if we encounter a task that is already completed, we skip it.\n   - If we encounter a task that is not yet completed, we add it to the `tasks_completed` set and increment the `travel_count`.\n5. **Final Output**: Finally, we print the total number of times Okabe time travels modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly simulate the time travel and check for the funny scene condition efficiently.", "```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    n = data[0]\n    tasks = [data[i:i+2] for i in range(1, 2*n, 2)]\n    t = data[2*n]\n    s = data[2*n+1:t+1]\n    \n    # Sort tasks by their start time\n    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    # Initialize variables\n    current_time = 0\n    time_travel_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through tasks\n    for task in tasks:\n        start_time, end_time = task\n        \n        # Calculate the time difference between the current time and the start time of the task\n        time_diff = max(0, start_time - current_time)\n        \n        # Add the time difference to the time travelled count\n        time_travel_count += time_diff % MOD\n        \n        # Update the current time to the end time of the task\n        current_time = end_time % MOD\n    \n    # Check if all tasks in the set s are completed\n    all_completed = True\n    for task in s:\n        if tasks[task-1][1] > current_time:\n            all_completed = False\n            break\n    \n    # Output the result\n    if all_completed:\n        print(time_travel_count % MOD)\n    else:\n        print(\"No funny scene\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a string and split into individual elements using `input().split()`.

This difference is added to the total time traveled count.\n5. **Checking Completion**: After processing all tasks, we check if all tasks in the set `s` are completed by comparing their end times with the current time.\n6. **Output**: Depending on whether all tasks in the set `s` are completed, we output the total time traveled count or indicate that there is no funny scene.\n\nThis solution ensures that the problem constraints are handled efficiently, and the correct number of time travels is computed.", "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the time travel process based on the given rules and count how many times Okabe time travels until all tasks in the set \\( S \\) are simultaneously completed.

{"id": "code_contests/43", "prompt": "# Omkar and Tours\n\nOmkar is hosting tours of his country, Omkarland! There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines. The i-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the i-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the i-th tour group.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n1 2 4 7\n1 3 2 8\n2 4 8 2\n2 5 1 1\n1 3\n9 5\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 8\n3 0\n3 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 4 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 2 1\n2 5 1 1\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 8\n1 3 6 3\n1 4 4 5\n1 5 7 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 8\n2 8\n2 3\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNote\n\nA map of the first sample is shown below. For the nodes, unbolded numbers represent indices and bolded numbers represent enjoyment values. For the edges, unbolded numbers represent capacities and bolded numbers represent tolls.\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 3 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 5 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

If the previous day was also watered, the flower grows by 5 cm; otherwise, it grows by 1 cm.\n   - If the flower was not watered, we reset the previous watered day to `None`.\n3. **Result Calculation**: After processing all days, we check if the flower still has a positive height. If it does, we print the height; otherwise, we print -1 indicating the flower died.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly simulate the growth of the flower based on the given rules and handle edge cases such as the flower dying due to insufficient watering over consecutive days.", "```python\ndef calculate_flower_height(days, watering_days):\n    # Initialize the height of the flower\n    height = 1\n    \n    # Iterate through each day\n    for i in range(1, days):\n        # Check if the flower is watered in this day\n        if watering_days[i] == 1:\n            # Calculate the growth based on whether the previous day was also watered\n            if watering_days[i-1] == 1:\n                height += 5\n            else:\n                height += 1\n        else:\n            # If the flower is not watered, the height remains unchanged\n            pass\n    \n    # Return the height of the flower after n days\n    return height\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\n\n# Process each test case\nfor _ in range(t):\n    # Read the number of days\n    days = int(input())\n    \n    # Read the list of watering days\n    watering_days = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Calculate and print the height of the flower\n    print(calculate_flower_height(days, watering_days))\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `calculate_flower_height` that takes the number of days and a list of watering days as input and returns the height of the flower after n days.

We will use dynamic programming to achieve this efficiently.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Read Input**: Read the length of the array \\( n \\) and the array \\( a \\).\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form an array of length \\( i \\) using numbers up to \\( j \\).\n3. **Initialization**: Initialize the base cases:\n   - `dp[0][j] = 1`: There is exactly one way to form an empty array.\n   - `dp[i][a_i] = 1`: There is exactly one way to form an array with a single element equal to \\( a_i \\).\n4. **Fill the DP Table**: Fill the DP table by considering all possible values of \\( b_i \\) and updating the counts accordingly.\n5. **Result**: Sum up the counts for all possible lengths and return the result modulo 998 244 353.\n\nHere's the Python implementation:\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef non_equal_neighbours(n, a):\n    # Initialize the DP table\n    dp = [[0] * (max(a) + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Base cases\n    for j in range(1, max(a) + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, max(a) + 1):\n            for k in range(1, j + 1):\n                if k <= a[i-1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][k]) % MOD\n    \n    # Sum up the counts for all possible lengths\n    result = sum(dp[n]) % MOD\n    \n    return result\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(non_equal_neighbours(n, a))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The `dp` table is initialized with dimensions `(n+1) x (max(a)+1)`.

We will use dynamic programming to achieve this.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Define the Problem**: We need to count the number of valid colorings of a perfect binary tree with 2^k - 1 nodes.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will use a DP table to store the number of valid colorings for subtrees rooted at each node.\n3. **Base Case**: For a leaf node, there is only one way to color it (either white or yellow).\n4. **Transition**: For an internal node, we can choose either color for the current node. If the parent node has a specific color, then the current node must have the opposite color.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we will take the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this solution:\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_colorings(n):\n    # Initialize the DP table\n    dp = [[0] * 6 for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Base case: Leaf nodes\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i][1] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the DP table\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(6):\n            dp[i][j] = (dp[i // 2][0] + dp[i // 2][1]) % MOD\n    \n    return dp[n][0]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Read input\n    k = int(input())\n    \n    # Calculate and print the result\n    result = count_colorings(k)\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid colorings for a subtree rooted at node `i` with color `j`.\n- **Base Case**: For leaf nodes, there are 2 choices (white or yellow), so `dp[i][0]` and `dp[i][1]` are both 1.\n- **Transition**: For an internal node, we consider both possible colors for the current node (`0` for white and `1` for yellow). If the parent node has color `j`, then the current node must have the opposite color (`j ^ 1`). Therefore, `dp[i][j]` is the sum of `dp[i // 2][0]` and `dp[i // 2][1]`.\n- **Result**: After filling the DP table, the answer is stored in `dp[n][0]`, which represents the number of valid colorings for the entire tree.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of valid colorings using dynamic programming and handle large numbers by taking the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).", "To solve the problem of counting the number of good colorings of a perfect binary tree of \\(2^k - 1\\) nodes, we need to consider the constraints on the adjacency of nodes in the Rubik's cube.

This means that for every edge between two nodes, the colors of these nodes must be adjacent sides in the Rubik's cube.\n\n2. **Recursive Approach**: We can use a recursive approach to count the number of valid colorings. For a perfect binary tree of height \\(k\\), we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to color the nodes up to a given level.\n\n3. **Base Case**: For a tree of height 1, there are 6 possible colors for the single node, so there are 6 colorings.\n\n4. **Recurrence Relation**: For a tree of height \\(k\\), we can split it into two subtrees of height \\(k-1\\). Each subtree has \\(2^{k-1}\\) nodes. Let \\(a_k\\) be the number of valid colorings of a tree of height \\(k\\). Then:\n   \\[\n   a_k = 2 \\cdot a_{k-1}\n   \\]\n   This is because each node in the tree can be either the root or a non-root node.

If the root is not colored, then the remaining \\(2^{k-1}\\) nodes also form a subtree of height \\(k-1\\).\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we need to take the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this solution:\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_good_colorings(k):\n    # Base case: There are 6 possible colors for a tree of height 1\n    if k == 1:\n        return 6\n    \n    # Initialize the DP array\n    dp = [0] * (k + 1)\n    dp[1] = 6\n    \n    # Fill the DP array using the recurrence relation\n    for i in range(2, k + 1):\n        dp[i] = 2 * dp[i - 1]\n    \n    # Return the result modulo MOD\n    return dp[k]\n\n# Read input\nk = int(input().strip())\n\n# Print the result\nprint(count_good_colorings(k))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Base Case**: If \\(k = 1\\), there are 6 possible colors for the single node.\n- **DP Array Initialization**: We initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the number of valid colorings for a tree of height \\(i\\).\n- **Filling the DP Array**: Using the recurrence relation \\(a_k = 2 \\cdot a_{k-1}\\), we fill the DP array up to the desired height \\(k\\).\n- **Result Modulo**: Finally, we return the value of `dp[k]` modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of good colorings using dynamic programming and handle large inputs correctly.", "```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_good_colorings(k):\n    # Base case: There's only one way to color a tree with 1 level\n    if k == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of ways to color a tree with 2^(k-1) levels\n    total_ways = pow(6, 2**(k-1), MOD)\n    \n    # Subtract the invalid colorings\n    invalid_ways = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, 2**(k-1)):\n        # Check if the current level has even or odd number of nodes\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # If it has even number of nodes, subtract the invalid colorings\n            invalid_ways += pow(3, i//2, MOD)\n        else:\n            # If it has odd number of nodes, subtract the invalid colorings\n            invalid_ways += pow(3, (i-1)//2, MOD)\n    \n    # Subtract the invalid colorings from the total number of ways\n    valid_ways = total_ways - invalid_ways\n    \n    return valid_ways\n\n# Read input\nk = int(input().strip())\n\n# Output the result\nprint(count_good_colorings(k))\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to color the first i nodes such that the j-th node has color j.\n\n3. **Base Cases**:\n   - If there are no nodes (`i = 0`), there is exactly one way to color them (all nodes are uncolored).\n   - If there is only one node (`i = 1`), it must be colored with one of the 6 colors.\n\n4. **Transition**:\n   - For each node, we need to consider the possible colors for the current node and update the dp table accordingly.\n   - The current node can be colored with any color except the color of its parent node (if it exists).\n\n5. **Special Nodes**: Since the colors of some nodes are already known, we need to handle these cases separately.\n\nHere's the Python implementation:\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_good_colorings(k, n, nodes):\n    # Initialize dp table\n    dp = [[0] * 6 for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Base case: no nodes\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill dp table\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(6):\n            if i == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = 1\n                continue\n            \n            # Check the color of the parent node\n            if i > 1 and (i >> 1) % 2 == 1:\n                if j == 0 or j == 1:\n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i // 2][j]\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i // 2][j - 1]\n            elif i > 1 and (i >> 1) % 2 == 0:\n                if j == 3 or j == 4:\n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i // 2][j]\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i // 2][j - 1]\n            \n            dp[i][j] %= MOD\n    \n    return sum(dp[-1]) % MOD\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\nn = int(data[0])\nnodes = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    v, s = data[2 * _], data[2 * _ + 1]\n    nodes.append((int(v), s))\n\n# Sort nodes by their indices\nnodes.sort()\n\n# Calculate the number of good colorings\nresult = count_good_colorings(k, n, nodes)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to color the first `i` nodes such that the `j`-th node has color `j`.\n2. **Base Case**: For `i = 0`, there is exactly one way to color the nodes (none). For `i = 1`, there is exactly one way to color the node (with one of the 6 colors).\n3. **Transition**: For each node, we check the color of its parent node and update the dp table accordingly.\n4. **Sorting**: We sort the nodes by their indices to ensure that we process them in the correct order.\n5. **Result**: Finally, we print the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly count the number of good colorings while handling the constraints and properties of the problem.", "```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef dfs(node, parent, used):\n    global count\n    for child in [node*2, node*2+1]:\n        if child not in used:\n            used.add(child)\n            if parent != -1:\n                if (used[child] == 'W' and used[parent] == 'Y') or \\\n                   (used[child] == 'Y' and used[parent] == 'W') or \\\n                   (used[child] == 'G' and used[parent] == 'B') or \\\n                   (used[child] == 'B' and used[parent] == 'G') or \\\n                   (used[child] == 'R' and used[parent] == 'O') or \\\n                   (used[child] == 'O' and used[parent] == 'R'):\n                    continue\n            count += dfs(child, node, used)\n            count %= MOD\n            used.remove(child)\n\ndef main():\n    k = int(input())\n    n = int(input())\n    used = set()\n    for _ in range(n):\n        v, s = map(int, input().split())\n        used.add(v)\n        used.add(s)\n    \n    # Initialize the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(1, 2**(k-1)):\n        graph[i].append(i*2)\n        graph[i].append(i*2+1)\n    \n    # Start DFS from root node\n    count = 0\n    dfs(1, -1, used)\n    print(count % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible colorings of the binary tree. It keeps track of the used nodes and checks for adjacent nodes to ensure they do not have the same color as their parent node.

So, `dp[1][2] = 1`.\n\n4. **Transition**:\n   - For each node \\(i\\), we can choose one of the remaining \\(j-1\\) colors. However, we need to ensure that the chosen color does not violate the adjacency rules.\n   - If the parent of node \\(i\\) has a certain color, then the child cannot have that color. Therefore, we need to exclude those colors from our choices.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - Use a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and populate the DP table.\n   - For each node, calculate the number of valid colorings based on the colors of its children and the constraints.\n\nHere's the complete Python script implementing the above approach:\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef dfs(node, parent_color):\n    global dp, colors\n    if dp[node][colors[node]] != -1:\n        return dp[node][colors[node]]\n    \n    # Initialize the number of valid colorings\n    dp[node][colors[node]] = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over possible colors\n    for color in range(1, 7):\n        if color == parent_color:\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the current node is a leaf or has a valid child\n        if node == 0 or (node > 0 and dp[2*node][color] >= 1 and dp[2*node+1][color] >= 1):\n            dp[node][colors[node]] += 1\n    \n    # Take modulo\n    dp[node][colors[node]] %= MOD\n    \n    return dp[node][colors[node]]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    \n    # Read input\n    k = int(input().strip())\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    nodes = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        v, s = input().strip().split()\n        v = int(v)\n        s = s.strip()\n        nodes.append((v, s))\n    \n    # Create a list to store the colors of the nodes\n    colors = [None] * (2**k - 1)\n    for v, s in nodes:\n        colors[v - 1] = s\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[-1] * 7 for _ in range(2**k)]\n    \n    # Start DFS from the root node\n    result = dfs(0, None)\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Input Reading**: The input is read from standard input, and the number of levels `k`, the number of special nodes `n`, and the positions and colors of the special nodes are processed.\n2. **Color Array**: A list `colors` is used to store the colors of the nodes.\n3. **DP Table Initialization**: A 2D list `dp` is initialized with -1 to indicate that the values are not computed yet.\n4. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function calculates the number of valid colorings for a given node and its parent color.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is obtained by calling the `dfs` function starting from the root node.\n6. **Output**: The result is printed to standard output.\n\nThis script efficiently computes the number of valid colorings modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).", "To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and properties of the Rubik's cube coloring and the given binary tree structure.

If not, return `-1`.\n\n4. **Outputting the Result**:\n   - If a valid order exists, construct the output list where each element is a tuple containing the weight and the side ('L' or 'R') and print it.\n\nThis script should correctly handle the input and produce the desired output according to the problem statement.", "```python\ndef solve(weights, S):\n    weights.sort()\n    result = []\n    left_side = 0\n    right_side = sum(weights)\n    \n    for i in range(len(S)):\n        if S[i] == 'L':\n            if left_side >= right_side:\n                return [-1]\n            result.append((weights.pop(), 'L'))\n            left_side += weights[-1]\n        else:\n            if left_side < right_side:\n                return [-1]\n            result.append((weights.pop(0), 'R'))\n            right_side -= weights[0]\n    \n    return result\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    S = input().strip()\n    \n    result = solve(data, S)\n    for weight, side in result:\n        print(f\"{weight} {side}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sorting**: The weights are sorted in ascending order.\n2. **Initialization**: `left_side` is initialized to the total sum of all weights, and `right_side` is initialized to 0.\n3. **Processing Each Weight**:\n   - For each character in the string `S`, if it's `'L'`, the largest remaining weight is placed on the left side and its value is added to `left_side`.\n   - If it's `'R'`, the smallest remaining weight is placed on the right side and its value is subtracted from `right_side`.\n4. **Result Check**: After processing all weights, if `left_side` is not greater than or equal to `right_side`, it means the rules cannot be satisfied, and `-1` is returned.\n5. **Output**: Otherwise, the order of placing the weights is printed as specified.\n\nThis approach ensures that the weights are placed in such a way that the rules of the string `S` are satisfied."], "input_token_count": 501, "output_token_counts": [428, 485, 362, 583, 392], "total_token_counts": [929, 986, 863, 1084, 893], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false]}

Previously they performed Eenie Meenie Miney Mo game, but eventually as their restaurant list grew, they had to create a new game. This new game starts as they write restaurant names on N cards and align the cards in one line. Before the game begins, they both choose starting card and starting direction they are going to. They take turns in order one after another. After each turn, they move one card in their current direction. If they reach the end or beginning of the line of cards they change direction. Once they meet in a card, the card is marked for removal and is removed the first moment they both leave the card.\n\n<image> Example of how card is removed\n\nThey repeat this process until there is only one restaurant card left.

{"id": "code_contests/68", "prompt": "# Bubble Popping\n\nThere are N bubbles in a coordinate plane. Bubbles are so tiny that it can be assumed that each bubble is a point (X_i, Y_i). \n\nQ Bubble Cup finalists plan to play with the bubbles. Each finalist would link to use infinitely long Bubble Cup stick to pop some bubbles. The i-th finalist would like to place the stick in the direction of vector (dxi, dyi), and plays the following game until K_i bubbles are popped. The game starts with finalist placing the stick in the direction of vector (dx_i, dy_i), and sweeping it from the infinity to the left until it hits some bubble, which is immediately popped. It is guaranteed that only one bubble will be hit in this step. After that the finalist starts rotating the stick in the counter clockwise direction with the center of rotation in point where the previous bubble was popped. When the next bubble is hit, it is immediately popped and becomes the new center of rotation. The process continues until K_i bubbles have been popped. It is guaranteed that the stick won't hit two bubbles simultaneously in this process. \n\nFor each finalist find which bubble would be popped the last. Note that each game starts with the configuration of all N bubbles, so the games don't depend on the previous games. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer N \u2014 the number of bubbles. (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5)\n\nEach of the next N lines contains two integers. The i-th line contains integers X_i and Y_i \u2014 the coordinates of the i-th bubble.

The world you live in is a giant 10^9 \u00d7 10^9 grid, with squares having both coordinates between 1 and 10^9. \n\nYou know that the enemy base has the shape of a rectangle, with the sides parallel to the sides of the grid. The people of your world are extremely scared of being at the edge of the world, so you know that the base doesn't contain any of the squares on the edges of the grid (the x or y coordinate being 1 or 10^9). \n\nTo help you locate the base, you have been given a device that you can place in any square of the grid, and it will tell you the manhattan distance to the closest square of the base. The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a\u2212p|+|b\u2212q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy. Because of this, you need to make sure to never place the device inside the enemy base. \n\nUnfortunately, the device is powered by a battery and you can't recharge it. This means that you can use the device at most 40 times. \n\nInput\n\nThe input contains the answers to your queries. \n\nInteraction\n\nYour code is allowed to place the device on any square in the grid by writing \"? i j\" (1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 10^9). In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square (i,j) or -1 if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid. \n\nIf you recieve -1 instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than 40 queries. \n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \"! x y p q\" (1 \u2264 x \u2264 p\u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 q\u2264 10^9), where (x, y) is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest x and y coordinates, and (p, q) is the square inside the enemy base with the largest x and y coordinates. Note that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: \n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * See the documentation for other languages.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n? 2 2\n? 5 5\n? 4 7\n? 1 5\n! 2 3 4 5\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

These numbers represent factory tiles and they can go from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers should be looked in its binary form. Because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example number 10 in it's binary form is 1010, which means that it has a wall from the North side, it doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side and it doesn't have a wall on the West side.

If a wall exists on any side, the corresponding bit in the binary representation is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.\n   - We then sum up these bits to determine the room size.\n\n3. **Sorting Room Sizes**:\n   -

The first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of the construction.\n   - The following `n * m` lines contain the values of the tiles, where each value is an integer between 0 and 15.\n\n2. **Counting Walls**:\n   - A helper function `count_walls(x, y)` is defined to determine the number of walls around a given cell `(x, y)`.\n   - It checks each adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) and counts the cells with walls using bitwise AND operation (`& 1`).\n\n3. **Finding Walls Cells**:\n   - A list comprehension is used to find all cells that have walls by checking the count of walls for each cell.\n\n4. **Sorting Cells**:\n   - The list of walls cells is sorted based on the number of walls in descending order using the `sort()` method with a custom key function.\n\n5. **Printing Room Sizes**:\n   -

If the cell contains a wall (i.e., it's not zero), we check if it's part of a new room by looking at the cells above and to the left. If it's not part of any existing room, we count the number of consecutive cells with walls and add this count to our list of room sizes.\n3. **Sorting Rooms**: Finally, we sort the list of room sizes in descending order and print them.\n\nThis script reads the input from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the room sizes from biggest to smallest.", "```python\ndef calculate_room_sizes(n, m, tiles):\n    # Create a dictionary to store room sizes\n    room_sizes = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each row and column\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            # Convert the tile value to binary and count the set bits (walls)\n            tile_value = tiles[i][j]\n            walls = bin(tile_value).count('1')\n            \n            # Determine the room size based on the number of walls\n            if walls == 1:\n                room_size = 1\n            elif walls == 2:\n                room_size = 2\n            elif walls == 3:\n                room_size = 3\n            else:\n                room_size = 4\n            \n            # Update the room size in the dictionary\n            if room_size not in room_sizes:\n                room_sizes[room_size] = []\n            room_sizes[room_size].append((i, j))\n    \n    # Sort the room sizes in descending order\n    sorted_rooms = sorted(room_sizes.items(), key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n    \n    # Print the sorted room sizes\n    for room_size, positions in sorted_rooms:\n        print(room_size)\n\n# Read input\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntiles = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Calculate and print room sizes\ncalculate_room_sizes(n, m, tiles)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Reading Input**:\n   - The first line reads the dimensions \\(N\\) and \\(M\\).\n   - The following \\(N \\times M\\) lines read the values of the tiles.\n\n2. **Calculating Room Sizes**:\n   - For each tile, we convert its value to its binary representation.\n   - We count the number of set bits (which indicate walls) to determine the room size.\n   - We store the room sizes along with their coordinates in a dictionary.\n\n3. **Sorting and Printing**:\n   - We sort the room sizes in descending order.\n   - Finally, we print the sorted room sizes.\n\nThis script ensures that the factory facility is correctly identified and the room sizes are calculated and printed as required."], "input_token_count": 440, "output_token_counts": [467, 527, 337, 427, 454], "total_token_counts": [907, 967, 777, 867, 894], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false]}

Now Gorf is on the bottom of the well and has a long way up.\n\nThe surface of the well's walls vary in quality: somewhere they are slippery, but somewhere have convenient ledges. In other words, if Gorf is on x meters below ground level, then in one jump he can go up on any integer distance from 0 to a_x meters inclusive. (Note that Gorf can't jump down, only up).\n\nUnfortunately, Gorf has to take a break after each jump (including jump on 0 meters). And after jumping up to position x meters below ground level, he'll slip exactly b_x meters down while resting.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of jumps Gorf needs to reach ground level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300 000) \u2014 the depth of the well.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 i), where a_i is the maximum height Gorf can jump from i meters below ground level.\n\nThe third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_n (0 \u2264 b_i \u2264 n - i), where b_i is the distance Gorf will slip down if he takes a break on i meters below ground level.\n\nOutput\n\nIf Gorf can't reach ground level, print -1. Otherwise, firstly print integer k \u2014 the minimum possible number of jumps.\n\nThen print the sequence d_1,\\,d_2, \u2026,\\,d_k where d_j is the depth Gorf'll reach after the j-th jump, but before he'll slip down during the break.

After that he slip down by meter and stays on height 2 meters below ground level. Now, from here, he can reach ground level in one jump.\n\nIn the second example, Gorf can jump to one meter below ground level, but will slip down back to the bottom of the well. That's why he can't reach ground level.\n\nIn the third example, Gorf can reach ground level only from the height 5 meters below the ground level.

If it does, we increment `max_climbers` and update `current_difficulty` to the maximum of the current difficulty and the alpinist's neatness.\n4. **Output**: Finally, we print the value of `max_climbers`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of alpinists who can climb the mountain by using the highest neatness possible for each alpinist.", "```python\ndef max_climbers(n, d, alpinists):\n    # Sort alpinists based on their neatness and then by their skill\n    alpinists.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], -x[0]))\n    \n    current_difficulty = d\n    climbers_count = 0\n    \n    for s, a in alpinists:\n        # If the alpinist's skill allows them to climb the current mountain\n        if s <= current_difficulty:\n            climbers_count += 1\n            current_difficulty = max(current_difficulty, a)\n    \n    return climbers_count\n\n# Read input\nn, d = map(int, input().split())\nalpinists = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Output result\nprint(max_climbers(n, d, alpinists))\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. **Sort Alpinists**: We first sort the alpinists based on their neatness (in descending order) and then by their skill (also in descending order). This ensures that alpinists with higher neatness and/or higher skill have a better chance of being able to climb the mountain.\n\n2. **Initialize Variables**: We initialize `current_difficulty` to the initial difficulty of the mountain and `climbers_count` to 0. These variables will keep track of the current difficulty and the number of alpinists who can currently climb the mountain.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Alpinists**: For each alpineist, we check if their skill allows them to climb the current mountain (`s <= current_difficulty`). If it does, we increment the `climbers_count` and update `current_difficulty` to be the maximum of its current value and the alpinist's neatness (`max(current_difficulty, a)`).\n\n4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `climbers_count`, which represents the maximum number of alpinists who can climb the mountain if they choose the right order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always consider the best possible order to maximize the number of climbers who can reach the mountain."], "input_token_count": 597, "output_token_counts": [396, 369, 526, 391, 443], "total_token_counts": [993, 966, 1123, 988, 1040], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false]}

This means that for any subsequence, the product of its maximum and minimum values must be at least the sum of its elements.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a sequence to be perfect, the elements must be chosen in such a way that no matter how you choose a subsequence, the product of its maximum and minimum values will always be at least the sum of its elements. This implies that the sequence must be composed of numbers that are either equal or very close to each other.\n\n3. **Constructing the Sequence**: Given that the sequence must be perfect, the most efficient way to construct such a sequence is to use numbers that are either 1 or \\(n+1\\). If we use \\(k\\) ones and \\(m-k\\) \\(n+1\\)'s, then the sequence will be `[1, 1, \\ldots, 1, n+1, n+1, \\ldots, n+1]` with \\(k\\) ones and \\(m-k\\) \\(n+1\\)'s.\n\n4. **Counting the Valid Sequences**: We need to count the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) positions out of \\(n+m-1\\) positions for the ones, where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(m\\). This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n+m-1}{k}\\).\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we need to take the result modulo \\(M\\).\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this solution:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    return math.comb(n, k)\n\ndef perfect_sequences(n, m, M):\n    total_count = 0\n    for k in range(m + 1):\n        total_count += binomial_coefficient(n + m - 1, k)\n    return total_count % M\n\n# Read input\ninput_line = input().split()\nn = int(input_line[0])\nm = int(input_line[1])\n\n# Calculate the number of perfect sequences modulo M\nresult = perfect_sequences(n, m, 10**9 + 7)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function `binomial_coefficient`**: This function calculates the binomial coefficient using the `math.comb` function.\n2. **Function `perfect_sequences`**: This function iterates over all possible values of \\(k\\) (from 0 to \\(m\\)), calculates the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) positions out of \\(n+m-1\\) positions for the ones, and adds this to the total count.

For each subsequence, it checks if it is good using the `is_good_subsequence` function and increments the count of good sequences accordingly.\n3. **Input Reading**: The input consists of two space-separated integers \\(n\\) and \\(M\\), where \\(1 \\leq n \\leq 200\\) and \\(10^8 \\leq M \\leq 10^9\\).\n4. **Output**: The result is printed modulo \\(M\\).\n\nThis solution ensures that we efficiently count the number of perfect sequences modulo \\(M\\) using dynamic programming techniques and combinatorial methods.", "To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible perfect sequences and count them modulo \\(M\\).

Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of ways to distribute `j` indistinguishable items into `i` distinguishable bins with each bin having at most `x` items.\n\n3. **Base Cases**:\n   - `dp[0][0] = 1`: There is one way to distribute zero items into zero bins.\n   - `dp[0][j] = 0` for `j > 0`: It is impossible to distribute any items into zero bins.\n   - `dp[i][0] = 1` for `i > 0`: There is one way to distribute zero items into `i` bins.\n\n4. **Transition**:\n   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, and for each `j` from 1 to `min(k, x)`, update `dp[i][j]` as follows:\n     ```python\n     dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-x]\n     ```\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we need to take the result modulo 998244353 at each step.\n\nHere's the complete Python script implementing the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef mod(x):\n    return x % 998244353\n\ndef count_ways(n, x):\n    dp = [[0] * (x + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Base cases\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, min(i * x, x) + 1):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-x]\n    \n    return dp[n][k]\n\n# Read input\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate the number of ways\nresult = count_ways(n, x)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **mod function**: A helper function to ensure the result stays within the modulo limit.\n2. **count_ways function**: Implements the dynamic programming solution.\n3. **Reading Input**: Reads the values of `n` and `x` from the input.\n4. **Printing Output**: Prints the result of the function.\n\nThis script will correctly compute the number of ways to distribute the health points such that no hero survives after any round of fights, taking into account the constraints and modulo operation.", "```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef count_ways(n, x):\n    dp = [[0] * (x + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Base case: There's only one way to have 0 health points\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the DP table\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, x + 1):\n            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]) % MOD\n    \n    return dp[n][x]\n\n# Read input\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate and print the result\nprint(count_ways(n, x))\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem efficiently. The `count_ways` function initializes a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to have exactly `i` health points among `n` heroes when the maximum health point is `j`. The base case is that there's only one way to have 0 health points. Then, for each hero and each possible health point limit, it calculates the number of ways to achieve that health point limit using the previous values in the DP table. Finally, the total number of ways to have exactly `n` health points is returned, which is printed modulo `998244353`."], "input_token_count": 404, "output_token_counts": [304, 401, 299, 705, 329], "total_token_counts": [708, 805, 703, 1109, 733], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false]}

The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13.

Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the size of tree and the number of elves respectively.\n\nThe next n-1 lines of each test case each contains three integers, x, y, and v (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; -1 \u2264 v < 2^{30}) \u2014 meaning that there's an edge between nodes x and y. If \n\n  * v = -1: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. \n  * v \u2265 0: The set of lights on the edge is v. \n\n\n\nThe next m lines of each test case each contains three integers, a, b, and p (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n; a \u2260 b; 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1) \u2014 the nodes that the elf was assigned to, and the parity of the number of set bits in the elf's favorite number.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n and the sum of all m don't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 each.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first print either YES or NO (in any case), whether there's a tree consistent with Santa's memory or not. \n\nIf the answer is YES, print n-1 lines each containing three integers: x, y, and v (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; 0 \u2264 v < 2^{30}) \u2014 the edge and the integer on that edge. The set of edges must be the same as in the input, and if the value of some edge was specified earlier, it can not change. You can print the edges in any order.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n6 5\n1 2 -1\n1 3 1\n4 2 7\n6 3 0\n2 5 -1\n2 3 1\n2 5 0\n5 6 1\n6 1 1\n4 5 1\n5 3\n1 2 -1\n1 3 -1\n1 4 1\n4 5 -1\n2 4 0\n3 4 1\n2 3 1\n3 3\n1 2 -1\n1 3 -1\n1 2 0\n1 3 1\n2 3 0\n2 1\n1 2 1\n1 2 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\n1 2 0\n1 3 1\n2 4 7\n3 6 0\n2 5 0\nYES\n1 2 1\n1 3 0\n1 4 1\n4 5 1\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first test case is the image in the statement.\n\nOne possible answer is assigning the value of the edge (1, 2) to 5, and the value of the edge (2, 5) to 3. This is correct because: \n\n  * The first elf goes from node 2 to node 3. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the value 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The second elf goes from node 2 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 3, so he remembers the value 0 (as 3 has an even number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The third elf goes from node 5 to node 6. This elf's favorite number is 7, so he remembers the value 1 (as 7 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fourth elf goes from node 6 to node 1. This elf's favorite number is 1, so he remembers the value 1 (as 1 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fifth elf goes from node 4 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the number 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n\n\n\nNote that there are other possible answers.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

The mischievous duo is now vandalizing a rooted tree, by coloring the nodes while playing their favorite game.\n\nThe game works as follows: there is a tree of size n, rooted at node 1, where each node is initially white. Red and Blue get one turn each. Red goes first. \n\nIn Red's turn, he can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree red. \n\nHowever, to make the game fair, Red is only allowed to color k nodes of the tree. In other words, after Red's turn, at most k of the nodes can be colored red.\n\nThen, it's Blue's turn. Blue can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree blue. However, he's not allowed to choose a subtree that contains a node already colored red, as that would make the node purple and no one likes purple crayon. \n\nNote: there's no restriction on the number of nodes Blue can color, as long as he doesn't color a node that Red has already colored.\n\nAfter the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let w be the number of white nodes, r be the number of red nodes, and b be the number of blue nodes.

You can only add or remove Lego's at two adjacent positions at the same time, as otherwise your chubby fingers run into precision issues.\n\nYou want to know exactly how much time you'll spend playing with Legos.

If it's impossible to transform the starting state into the ending state, you just skip it (so you spend 0 seconds).\n\nThe issue is that, for some positions, you don't remember whether there were Legos there or not (in either the starting state, the ending state, or both).

Icy wants to make at least one pair of chocolates the same type. \n\nAs a result, she asks her grandparents to perform some chocolate exchanges. Before performing any chocolate exchanges, Icy chooses two chocolates with indices x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n, x \u2260 y).\n\nIn a chocolate exchange, Icy's grandparents choose a non-negative integer k, such that 2^k \u2265 a_x, and change the type of the chocolate x from a_x to 2^k - a_x (that is, perform a_x := 2^k - a_x).\n\nThe chocolate exchanges will be stopped only when a_x = a_y. Note that other pairs of equal chocolate types do not stop the procedure.\n\nIcy's grandparents are smart, so they would choose the sequence of chocolate exchanges that minimizes the number of exchanges needed. Since Icy likes causing trouble, she wants to maximize the minimum number of exchanges needed by choosing x and y appropriately. She wonders what is the optimal pair (x, y) such that the minimum number of exchanges needed is maximized across all possible choices of (x, y).\n\nSince Icy is not good at math, she hopes that you can help her solve the problem.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of chocolates.\n\nThe second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that all a_i are distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput three integers x, y, and m.\n\nx and y are indices of the optimal chocolates to perform exchanges on.

{"id": "code_contests/145", "prompt": "# Unusual Minesweeper\n\nPolycarp is very fond of playing the game Minesweeper. Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules.\n\nThere are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known (x_i, y_i). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of k (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a \"plus\" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines according to the rules described above.\n\nPolycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nAn empty line is written in front of each test suite.\n\nNext comes a line that contains integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.\n\nThen n lines follow, the i-th of which describes the x and y coordinates of the i-th mine and the time until its explosion (-10^9 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 timer \u2264 10^9). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values n over all test cases in the test does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data \u2014 the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n\n5 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n5 2\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n6 1\n1 -1 3\n0 -1 9\n0 1 7\n-1 0 1\n-1 1 9\n-1 -1 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image> Picture from examples\n\nFirst example: \n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2), it does not detonate any other mine since k=0. \n  * 1 second: we explode the mine at the cell (0, 1), and the mine at the cell (0, 0) explodes itself. \n  * 2 second: we explode the mine at the cell (1, 1), and the mine at the cell (1, 0) explodes itself.\n\n\n\nSecond example:\n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2) we get: \n\n<image>\n\n  * 1 second: the mine at coordinate (0, 0) explodes and since k=2 the explosion detonates mines at the cells (0, 1) and (1, 0), and their explosions detonate the mine at the cell (1, 1) and there are no mines left on the field. \n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/160", "prompt": "# Robot Cleaner\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirty cell. Each second the robot cleans a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the time for the robot to do its job.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

In one turn, Alice picks a range [l, r] from the set S and asks Bob to pick a number in the range. Bob chooses a number d (l \u2264 d \u2264 r). Then Alice removes [l, r] from S and puts into the set S the range [l, d - 1] (if l \u2264 d - 1) and the range [d + 1, r] (if d + 1 \u2264 r). The game ends when the set S is empty. We can show that the number of turns in each game is exactly n.\n\nAfter playing the game, Alice remembers all the ranges [l, r] she picked from the set S, but Bob does not remember any of the numbers that he picked. But Bob is smart, and he knows he can find out his numbers d from Alice's ranges, and so he asks you for help with your programming skill.\n\nGiven the list of ranges that Alice has picked ([l, r]), for each range, help Bob find the number d that Bob has picked.\n\nWe can show that there is always a unique way for Bob to choose his number for a list of valid ranges picked by Alice.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Each line should contain three integers l, r, and d, denoting that for Alice's range [l, r] Bob picked the number d.\n\nYou can print the lines in any order.

Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not \u2261 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x \u22c5 y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 \u2264 a < 10^9 + 7 and a \u22c5 y \u2261 x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10).

Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same. The only difference is that the position of the dirty cell and the robot are swapped. But the movements in both cases are identical, hence the same result.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.
