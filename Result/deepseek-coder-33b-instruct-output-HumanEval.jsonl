The DFS function then tries to extend the current path by visiting each of the neighboring cells that have not been visited yet.

It uses a priority queue to always process the cell with the smallest value first. The priority queue stores tuples of the form (value, x, y, path), where value is the value of the cell, (x, y) are the coordinates of the cell, and path is the path from the top-left cell to the current cell.\n\nThe solution also keeps track of visited cells to avoid visiting the same cell multiple times. When a path of length k is found, it returns the path. If no path of length k is found, it returns an empty list.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 log n) where n is the size of the grid. This is because each cell is pushed and popped from the priority queue at most once, and each push and pop operation takes O(log n) time. The space complexity is also O(n^2) because the visited set and the priority queue can each contain at most n^2 elements.\n", "Here is a Python solution using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Each path is represented as a tuple of (distance, x, y, path), where distance is the total distance of the path, (x, y) is the current cell, and path is the ordered list of the values on the cells that the path goes through.\n\nThe heap is initialized with a path starting from the top-left cell of the grid. Then, in each iteration, the path with the smallest distance is popped from the heap. If the path's length is equal to k, it is returned as the result. Otherwise, the algorithm tries to extend the path to its neighbor cells by pushing new paths into the heap.\n\nThe algorithm continues until the heap is empty, which means there is no path of length k.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the grid is a square grid.
