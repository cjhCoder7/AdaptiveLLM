Append the remainder of the division of the largest two elements to the array.\n4. Remove the two largest elements from the array.\n5. Repeat the process until the largest element is 0.\n6. Return the length of the remaining array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are always reducing the array size efficiently and eventually, the array length will be minimized to 1 if all elements become 0.", " To solve the problem of minimizing the length of the array `nums` by performing the given operations, we need to understand the effect of each operation on the array. The key insight is that each operation reduces the number of elements in the array by one and potentially changes the values of the remaining elements.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Operation Analysis**:\n   - When we perform the operation `nums[i] % nums[j]` and insert the result at the end of the array, we are effectively reducing the value at index `i` by a multiple of `nums[j]`.\n   - This operation will continue to reduce the values until the remainder is less than `nums[j]`.\n   - The operation will also reduce the length of the array by 2 (since two elements are deleted).\n\n2. **Minimum Length**:\n   - The minimum length of the array is determined by the smallest non-zero value that can be obtained through the operations.\n   - If all elements in the array eventually become zero, the minimum length will be the number of elements that can be reduced to zero.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Simulation of Operations**:\n   - We need to simulate the operations to see how the array evolves.\n   - We can use a priority queue (heap) to always pick the largest two elements for the operation to ensure the fastest reduction.\n\n2. **Termination Condition**:\n   - The process terminates when no more valid operations can be performed (i.e., all elements are zero).\n\n### Implementation:\nWe will use a priority queue to efficiently pick the largest elements for the operation. Here is the Python code to implement this strategy:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumArrayLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        heapq.heapify(nums)\n        \n        while len(nums) > 1:\n            a = heapq.heappop(nums)\n            b = heapq.heappop(nums)\n            if a % b == 0:\n                heapq.heappush(nums, b)\n            else:\n                heapq.heappush(nums, b)\n                heapq.heappush(nums, a % b)\n        \n        return len(nums)\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minimumArrayLength([1, 4, 3, 1]))  # Output: 1\nprint(sol.minimumArrayLength([5, 5, 5, 10, 5]))  # Output: 2\nprint(sol.minimumArrayLength([2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Heap Initialization**:\n   - We initialize the heap with the elements of `nums`.\n\n2. **Operation Loop**:\n   - We repeatedly pop the two largest elements from the heap.\n   - We perform the operation `a % b` and push the result back into the heap if the result is not zero.\n   - We continue this process until the heap contains only one element.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - The length of the heap after all operations will be the minimum length of the array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently reduce the array length by always picking the largest elements for the operation, which helps in minimizing the number of operations required."], "input_token_count": 1054, "output_token_counts": [858, 655, 761, 671, 763], "total_token_counts": [1912, 1709, 1815, 1725, 1817], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [116.0, 168.0, 191.0, 225.0, 192.0], "average_thinking_time": 183.66666666666666}

A number has a trailing zero if its binary representation ends with one or more zeros. This means that the bitwise OR of two or more numbers will have a trailing zero if at least one of the numbers has a trailing zero in its binary representation.\n\nTo determine if a number has a trailing zero, we can check if it is a power of 2. A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation.

It does this by using the property that a power of 2 has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation (`n & (n - 1)) == 0`).\n\n2. **Filtering Powers of 2**: We create a list `powers_of_2` containing all numbers in `nums` that are powers of 2.\n\n3. **Checking Pairs**: We iterate through all pairs of numbers in `powers_of_2` and check if their bitwise OR results in a number with a trailing zero. This is done by checking if the result of the OR operation and its predecessor are not equal to 0 (`(powers_of_2[i] | powers_of_2[j] & (powers_of_2[i] | powers_of_2[j] - 1) != 0)`).\n\n4. **Return Result**: If any valid pair is found, we return `true`.

1]:\n                return False\n        return True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Outer Loop**: Iterate through each starting index `i` of the subarray.\n2. **Inner Loop**: Iterate through each ending index `j` of the subarray.\n3. **Check Function**: Use a helper function `isStrictlyIncreasing` to check if the array remains strictly increasing after removing the subarray `[i:j+1]`.\n4. **Count**: Increment the count for each valid subarray.\n\n### Time Complexity:\n- The outer loop runs \\(O(n^2)\\) times.\n- The inner loop runs \\(O(n)\\) times.\n- The check function runs \\(O(n)\\) times.\n- Overall, the time complexity is \\(O(n^3)\\), which is acceptable given the constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly count all incremovable subarrays in the array.", " To solve the problem of counting the number of incremovable subarrays, we need to understand the conditions under which a subarray can be removed without breaking the strictly increasing property of the array.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Strictly Increasing Property**: A subarray is incremovable if removing it results in a strictly increasing array.\n2. **Subarray Definition**: A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within the array.\n3. **Empty Subarray**: An empty subarray is not considered.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Iterate Over All Possible Subarrays**: We need to check each possible subarray to see if removing it results in a strictly increasing array.\n2. **Check Strictly Increasing**: For each subarray, simulate the removal and check if the remaining array is strictly increasing.\n\n### Implementation:\n1. **Nested Loops**: Use two nested loops to generate all possible subarrays.\n2. **Check Function**: Create a helper function to check if an array is strictly increasing.\n3. **Count Valid Subarrays**: Count the number of subarrays that, when removed, result in a strictly increasing array.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def incremovableSubarrayCount(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        def is_strictly_increasing(arr):\n            return all(arr[i] < arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))\n        \n        n = len(nums)\n        count = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):\n                if is_strictly_increasing(nums[i:j]):\n                    count += 1\n        \n        return count\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.incremovableSubarrayCount([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 10\nprint(sol.incremovableSubarrayCount([6, 5, 7, 8]))  # Output: 7\nprint(sol.incremovableSubarrayCount([8, 7, 6, 6]))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **is_strictly_increasing Function**: This function checks if a given list is strictly increasing.\n2. **Nested Loops**: The outer loop (`i`) starts from the beginning of the array, and the inner loop (`j`) goes up to the end of the array. This ensures all possible subarrays are considered.\n3. **Counting Valid Subarrays**: For each subarray `nums[i:j]`, we check if it is strictly increasing. If it is, we increment the count.\n\n### Complexity:\n- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n^3)\\) in the worst case, where \\(n\\) is the length of the array. This is because for each subarray, we need to check if it is strictly increasing, which involves iterating through the subarray.\n- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) since we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size.\n\nThis approach is straightforward but may not be the most efficient for large arrays due to its cubic time complexity.

The goal is to ensure that the sum of the differences between the elements in the window and the maximum element in the window is at most `k`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Frequency**: As we slide the window, calculate the frequency of the most frequent element in the current window.\n\n4. **Maximize the Frequency**: Track the maximum frequency encountered during the sliding window operations.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\nimport collections\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxFrequencyScore(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        left = 0\n        total = 0\n        max_freq = 1\n        \n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            total += nums[right]\n            \n            while nums[right] * (right - left + 1) > total + k:\n                total -= nums[left]\n                left += 1\n            \n            max_freq = max(max_freq, right - left + 1)\n        \n        return max_freq\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.maxFrequencyScore([1, 2, 6, 4], 3))  # Output: 3\n# print(sol.maxFrequencyScore([1, 4, 4, 2, 4], 0))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting**: We start by sorting the array `nums`.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window. We maintain a `total` sum of the elements in the current window.\n\n3. **Adjusting the Window**: For each `right` pointer, we add the current element to `total`. If the product of the current element and the size of the window exceeds the sum of the window plus `k`, we need to shrink the window from the left. We do this by subtracting the leftmost element from `total` and moving the `left` pointer to the right.\n\n4. **Updating Maximum Frequency**: After adjusting the window, we update `max_freq` with the size of the current window, which represents the maximum frequency we can achieve.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum frequency by leveraging the sorted order and the sliding window technique."], "input_token_count": 540, "output_token_counts": [574, 642, 730, 735, 644], "total_token_counts": [1114, 1182, 1270, 1275, 1184], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [195.0, 198.0, 257.0, 270.0, 107.0], "average_thinking_time": 216.66666666666666}

If we encounter a number that has already been seen, we break out of the inner loop. If the number is in `num_to_index`, we update `dp[j + 1]` to be the sum of `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[i]`, taking modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of good partitions while handling large inputs within the constraints.", " To solve the problem of counting the number of good partitions of the array `nums`, we need to ensure that no two subarrays contain the same number.

The idea is to maintain a window that contains at most `k` different elements, and we expand and contract this window to find the longest subarray that satisfies the condition.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - A dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window.\n   - Two pointers `left` and `right` to represent the start and end of the window.\n   - A variable `max_length` to store the maximum length of the good subarray found.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**:\n   - Use the `right` pointer to expand the window to the right.\n   - Update the frequency of the current element in the `freq` dictionary.\n   - If the number of unique elements in the window exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right to shrink the window from the left.\n   - After each expansion or contraction, update `max_length` if the current window length is greater than the previously recorded maximum length.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - After processing all elements, return `max_length`.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSubarrayLength(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        freq = defaultdict(int)\n        left = 0\n        max_length = 0\n        \n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            freq[nums[right]] += 1\n            \n            while len(freq) > k:\n                freq[nums[left]] -= 1\n                if freq[nums[left]] == 0:\n                    del freq[nums[left]]\n                left += 1\n            \n            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n        \n        return max_length\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.maxSubarrayLength([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2], 2))  # Output: 6\nprint(sol.maxSubarrayLength([1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], 1))  # Output: 2\nprint(sol.maxSubarrayLength([5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], 4))     # Output: 4\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize `freq` as a `defaultdict` to store the frequency of elements in the current window. `left` is set to 0, and `max_length` is initialized to 0.\n- **Sliding Window**:\n  - For each `right` pointer, we increment the frequency of the current element in `freq`.\n  - If the number of unique elements in `freq` exceeds `k`, we move the `left` pointer to the right, decrementing the frequency of the element at `left` and removing it from `freq` if its count drops to 0.\n  - After adjusting the window, we update `max_length` with the maximum of the current window length (`right - left + 1`).\n- **Return**: Finally, we return `max_length` which holds the length of the longest good subarray.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest subarray with the required property using a sliding window technique."], "input_token_count": 625, "output_token_counts": [668, 851, 691, 776, 828], "total_token_counts": [1293, 1476, 1316, 1401, 1453], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [45.0, 132.0, 85.0, 108.0, 66.0], "average_thinking_time": 86.33333333333333}

1] != -1:\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) % MOD\n            if i < n - 1 and dp[i + 1] != -1:\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i + 1]) % MOD\n        \n        result = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if dp[i] != -1:\n                result = (result + dp[i]) % MOD\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `dp` array is initialized with zeros.\n   - Infected positions are marked with `-1` in the `dp` array.\n\n2. **Transition**:\n   - For each child `i`, if it is not infected (`dp[i] != -1`), we update `dp[i]` by adding the number of ways to infect from the previous and next children, if they are not infected (`dp[i - 1] != -1` and `dp[i + 1] != -1`).\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - The final result is the sum of all non-infected positions in the `dp` array, modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of possible infection sequences while adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.", " To solve this problem, we need to count the number of possible infection sequences where each non-infected child can get infected in one of the possible ways, given that at most one child can get infected in each second.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the non-infected children**: The children who are not in the `sick` array are the ones that can potentially get infected.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to infect each non-infected child.\n3. **Transition Calculation**: For each non-infected child, calculate the number of ways to infect it based on the children it is adjacent to.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, use modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfSequence(self, n: int, sick: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        \n        # Create a list to mark infected children\n        infected = [False] * n\n        for pos in sick:\n            infected[pos] = True\n        \n        # Initialize dp array where dp[i] represents the number of ways to infect the i-th non-infected child\n        dp = [0] * n\n        \n        # Base case: the first non-infected child can be infected directly\n        if not infected[1]:\n            dp[1] = 1\n        \n        # Fill the dp array\n        for i in range(2, n):\n            if not infected[i]:\n                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD\n        \n        # The result is the number of ways to infect the last non-infected child\n        return dp[n - 1]\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.numberOfSequence(5, [0, 4]))  # Output: 4\n# print(sol.numberOfSequence(4, [1]))      # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We create a list `infected` to mark which children are infected.\n   - We initialize the `dp` array where `dp[i]` will store the number of ways to infect the `i-th` non-infected child.\n\n2. **Base Case**:\n   - If the second child (position 1) is not infected, we can start the infection sequence from there, so `dp[1] = 1`.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:\n   - For each non-infected child `i`, we calculate the number of ways to infect it by summing the ways to infect the previous two non-infected children (`dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`).\n   - We use modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure the numbers remain within standard integer limits.\n\n4. **Result**:\n   - The result is the number of ways to infect the last non-infected child, which is stored in `dp[n - 1]`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of possible infection sequences while adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.", " To solve this problem, we need to count the number of possible infection sequences where at most one child gets infected in each second. The key observation is that the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where we consider the possible positions for the next infection given the current state of the infected and non-infected children.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We need to keep track of the number of ways to reach each position in the queue. We'll use dynamic programming to achieve this.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We'll maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the `i-th` position in the queue.\n3. **Base Cases**: \n   - `dp[sick[0]] = 1`: The first infected child can only be at the first position.\n   - For positions between the first and last infected child, we need to consider the possible ways to reach each position.\n4. **Transition**: For each position `i`, if `i` is not infected and is adjacent to at least one infected position, we can calculate the number of ways to reach `i` by summing the ways to reach the adjacent infected positions.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we'll take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfSequence(self, n: int, sick: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if not sick:\n            return pow(2, n - 1, MOD)\n        \n        dp = [0] * n\n        dp[sick[0]] = 1\n        \n        for i in range(1, len(sick)):\n            for j in range(sick[i-1] + 1, sick[i]):\n                dp[j] = (dp[j-1] if j > 0 else 0) + (dp[j+1] if j < n - 1 else 0)\n            dp[sick[i]] = dp[sick[i-1]]\n        \n        for j in range(sick[-1] + 1, n):\n            dp[j] = (dp[j-1] if j > 0 else 0) + (dp[j+1] if j < n - 1 else 0)\n        \n        return sum(dp) % MOD\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.numberOfSequence(5, [0, 4]))  # Output: 4\n# print(sol.numberOfSequence(4, [1]))      # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize the `dp` array with zeros and set `dp[sick[0]] = 1` because the first infected child can only be at the first position.\n2. **Transition**: For each infected position `sick[i]`, we update the `dp` array for positions between `sick[i-1]` and `sick[i]`. We use the previous values of `dp` to calculate the current values.\n3. **Final Update**: After processing all infected positions, we update the `dp` array for positions after the last infected position.\n4. **Result**: The result is the sum of all values in the `dp` array modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of possible infection sequences by considering the possible transitions at each step.", " To solve this problem, we need to count the number of possible infection sequences where each non-infected child can get infected by either of its two neighboring infected children. Given that the `sick` array is sorted in increasing order, we can use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of sequences.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to infect the children from position `0` to `i`.\n   - Initialize `dp[i]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.\n\n2. **Base Case**:\n   - If the first child (position `0`) is infected, there are no ways to infect the rest of the children before it, so `dp[0] = 1`.\n   - If the first child is not infected, there is one way to infect it (by itself getting infected), so `dp[0] = 1`.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:\n   - For each position `i` from `1` to `n-1`, calculate the number of ways to infect the children from position `0` to `i`.\n   - If the current position `i` is not in the `sick` array, it can be infected by either of its neighbors.\n   - If the current position `i` is in the `sick` array, it cannot be infected by itself, but it can be infected by its neighbors.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**:\n   - Since the result can be very large, take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfSequence(self, n: int, sick: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        dp = [0] * n\n        dp[0] = 1\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if i in sick:\n                dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n            else:\n                if i > 0:\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-1]) % MOD\n                if i > 1:\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-2]) % MOD\n        \n        return dp[n-1]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Initialization**: `dp` array is initialized with zeros and `dp[0]` is set to `1` because there's one way to infect the first child (either by itself or by being adjacent to an infected child).\n- **Loop through positions**: For each position `i` from `1` to `n-1`, check if `i` is in the `sick` array.\n  - If `i` is in `sick`, it can only be infected by its previous neighbor (since it cannot be infected by itself).\n  - If `i` is not in `sick`, it can be infected by either of its neighbors (if they exist and are infected).\n- **Modulo Operation**: Ensure that the results are within the limit by taking modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of possible infection sequences using dynamic programming.", " To solve this problem, we need to count the number of possible infection sequences where each non-infected child can get infected in one of the possible ways by choosing one of its two neighbors to infect.

The total number of swaps required can be calculated by summing up the number of black balls to the left of each position and the number of white balls to the right of each position.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumSteps(self, s: str) -> int:\n        n = len(s)\n        black_count = 0\n        steps = 0\n        \n        # Count the number of black balls to the left of each position\n        for i in range(n):\n            if s[i] == '1':\n                steps += black_count\n            else:\n                black_count += 1\n        \n        return steps\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minimumSteps(\"101\"))  # Output: 1\nprint(sol.minimumSteps(\"100\"))  # Output: 2\nprint(sol.minimumSteps(\"0111\")) # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize `black_count` to keep track of the number of black balls encountered so far and `steps` to accumulate the total number of swaps required.\n2. **Iteration**: We iterate through the string `s`:\n   - If the current character is '1' (black ball), we add the number of black balls encountered so far (`black_count`) to `steps` because we need to swap all these black balls to the right.\n   - If the current character is '0' (white ball), we increment `black_count` because we will need to swap this white ball to the left in the future.\n3. **Return**: Finally, we return the accumulated `steps` which represents the minimum number of swaps required to group all black balls to the right and all white balls to the left.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum number of swaps with a single pass through the string, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).", " To solve this problem, we need to count the number of black balls (represented by `1`s) that are to the left of any white ball (represented by `0`s) and vice versa.

This ensures that the stack only contains buildings that are taller than the current building.\n\n3. **Processing Queries**: For each query, if Alice and Bob are in the same building, we set the result to that building. Otherwise, we check the stacks of both buildings to see if there's a common building that they can move to.

This is not possible since the total number of candies `n` is less than or equal to `3 * limit`.\n\n4. **Implementation**: We will implement the above logic in a function and use combinatorial formulas to count the valid distributions.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:\n        ways = 0\n        \n        # Case 1: None of the children exceed the limit\n        if n <= 3 * limit:\n            ways += min(n, limit) + 1\n            if n > 2 * limit:\n                ways += (n - 2 * limit) * (min(n - limit, limit) + 1)\n            if n > limit:\n                ways += (n - limit) * (min(n - limit, limit) + 1)\n        \n        return ways\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.distributeCandies(5, 2))  # Output: 3\nprint(sol.distributeCandies(3, 3))  # Output: 10\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Case 1**: We count the number of ways where each child gets between 0 and `limit` candies. This is straightforward using the formula `min(n, limit) + 1`.\n- **Case 2**: We handle the case where one child gets more than `limit` candies. We calculate the number of ways for the remaining candies after one child exceeds the limit.\n- **Case 3**: This is not possible since the total number of candies `n` is less than or equal to `3 * limit`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we count all valid distributions without over-counting any scenarios.", " To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute `n` candies among 3 children such that no child gets more than `limit` candies. We can approach this problem by considering all possible distributions and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Define the Problem**: We need to find the number of ways to distribute `n` candies among 3 children where each child can receive between 0 and `limit` candies, and the total number of candies distributed is `n`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Distributions**: We will iterate over all possible distributions of candies among the 3 children. For each distribution, we will check if it meets the criteria (i.e., no child gets more than `limit` candies).\n\n3. **Count Valid Distributions**: For each distribution, we will count the number of ways to achieve that distribution.\n\n4. **Sum the Counts**: Finally, we will sum the counts of all valid distributions.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:\n        ways = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible distributions\n        for i in range(min(n, limit) + 1):\n            for j in range(min(n - i, limit) + 1):\n                k = n - i - j\n                if k <= limit:\n                    ways += 1\n        \n        return ways\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.distributeCandies(5, 2))  # Output: 3\nprint(sol.distributeCandies(3, 3))  # Output: 10\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Range of `i`, `j`, and `k`**:\n   - `i` ranges from 0 to `min(n, limit)` because the first child can receive between 0 and `min(n, limit)` candies.\n   - `j` ranges from 0 to `min(n - i, limit)` because the second child can receive between 0 and `min(n - i, limit)` candies, given the candies already given to the first child.\n   - `k` is the remaining candies for the third child, which is `n - i - j`. It must be less than or equal to `limit` to meet the criteria.\n\n2. **Counting Valid Distributions**:\n   - For each combination of `i`, `j`, and `k` that satisfies the condition, we increment the `ways` counter.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - Finally, we return the total count of valid distributions.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to distribute the candies while adhering to the constraints.", " To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute `n` candies among 3 children such that no child gets more than `limit` candies.

For each distribution, we will check if it meets the criteria (i.e., no child gets more than `limit` candies).\n\n3. **Count Valid Distributions**: For each distribution, we will check if the sum of candies received by the children is equal to `n` and if each child's share is within the `limit`.\n\n4. **Optimization**: Instead of iterating over all possible distributions, we can use a more efficient approach by leveraging combinatorial mathematics.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:\n        ways = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible distributions\n        for i in range(min(n, limit) + 1):  # i: candies given to the first child\n            for j in range(min(n - i, limit) + 1):  # j: candies given to the second child\n                k = n - i - j  # candies given to the third child\n                if 0 <= k <= limit:\n                    ways += 1\n        \n        return ways\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.distributeCandies(5, 2))  # Output: 3\nprint(sol.distributeCandies(3, 3))  # Output: 10\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Distributions**:\n   - We iterate over the possible number of candies `i` given to the first child (from 0 to `min(n, limit)`).\n   - For each `i`, we iterate over the possible number of candies `j` given to the second child (from 0 to `min(n - i, limit)`).\n   - The remaining candies `k` are given to the third child, and we check if `k` is within the limit.\n\n2. **Check Validity**:\n   - We check if `k` is within the range `[0, limit]`.

Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to form a string of length `i` such that the last character of the substring \"leet\" we are forming is `j` (where `j` is 0 for 'l', 1 for 'e', 2 for 'e' again, 3 for 't').\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We need to initialize the base cases for the first character.\n   - `dp[0][0] = 1` (one way to form an empty string ending with 'l')\n   - `dp[0][1] = dp[0][2] = dp[0][3] = 0` (no way to form a string ending with 'e' or 't' from an empty string)\n\n2. **Transition**: For each length `i` from 1 to `n`, and for each possible ending character `j`, we compute the number of ways to form such a string:\n   - If `j == 0` (ending with 'l'), the previous character must have been 'l' (to form \"ll\"), or 'e' (to form \"le\"), or 't' (to form \"lt\").\n   - If `j == 1` (ending with 'e'), the previous character must have been 'l' (to form \"le\"), or 'e' (to form \"ee\"), or 't' (to form \"et\").\n   - If `j == 2`, the previous character must have been 'e' (to form \"ee\"), or 't' (to form \"et\").\n   - If `j == 3`, the previous character must have been 'e' (to form \"et\").\n\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def stringCount(self, n: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        # dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form a string of length i ending with character j\n        dp = [[0] * 4 for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        dp[0][0] = 1  # Base case: one way to form an empty string ending with 'l'\n        \n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            # Ending with 'l'\n            dp[i][0] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][3]) % MOD\n            # Ending with 'e'\n            dp[i][1] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][2]) % MOD\n            # Ending with 'e' again\n            dp[i][2] = (dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][2]) % MOD\n            # Ending with 't'\n            dp[i][3] = dp[i - 1][2] % MOD\n        \n        # The result is the sum of all ways to end with 'l', 'e', 'e', 't'\n        return (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1] + dp[n][2] + dp[n][3]) % MOD\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.stringCount(4))  # Output: 12\nprint(sol.stringCount(10)) # Output: 83943898\n```\n\nThis code initializes the dynamic programming table, fills it according to the transitions, and finally returns the result modulo `10^9 + 7`."], "input_token_count": 500, "output_token_counts": [911, 1005, 930, 763, 974], "total_token_counts": [1411, 1505, 1430, 1263, 1474], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [215.0, 133.0, 88.0, 68.0, 80.0], "average_thinking_time": 100.33333333333333}

This can be achieved by sorting the indices based on the value of the elements they point to, and then using dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of a subsequence that satisfies the condition.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Pair Elements with Their Indices**: Create a list of pairs where each pair consists of an element and its index.\n2. **Sort the Pairs**: Sort these pairs based on the value of the elements.\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of a subsequence that satisfies the condition.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxBalancedSubsequenceSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Pair each element with its index\n        indexed_nums = [(num, idx) for idx, num in enumerate(nums)]\n        \n        # Sort the pairs based on the value of the elements\n        indexed_nums.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        \n        # Initialize a list to store the maximum sum ending at each index\n        dp = [0] * len(nums)\n        max_sum = float('-inf')\n        \n        # Iterate through the sorted pairs\n        for i in range(len(indexed_nums)):\n            val, idx = indexed_nums[i]\n            dp[idx] = max(val, val + max(dp[j] for j in range(idx) if j < idx and indexed_nums[j][1] < idx))\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[idx])\n        \n        return max_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.maxBalancedSubsequenceSum([3, 3, 5, 6]))  # Output: 14\nprint(sol.maxBalancedSubsequenceSum([5, -1, -3, 8]))  # Output: 13\nprint(sol.maxBalancedSubsequenceSum([-2, -1]))  # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Pairing Elements with Their Indices**:\n   - We create a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `nums` and its index.\n   - This helps us keep track of the original positions of the elements.\n\n2. **Sorting the Pairs**:\n   - We sort the list of tuples based on the values of the elements.

This helps in ensuring that for any subsequence to be balanced, the difference between consecutive elements in the subsequence must be at least the difference between their indices.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming with Monotonic Queue**: We use a dynamic programming approach where we maintain a maximum sum for each possible starting index of a balanced subsequence.

This can be done using a set to keep track of the distinct elements.\n\n3. **Square the distinct counts**: Once we have the distinct count for a subarray, we square it.\n\n4. **Sum the squares**: Finally, we sum up all the squared distinct counts to get the desired result.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach in Python:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def sumCounts(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i, n):\n                distinct_count = len(set(nums[i:j+1]))\n                total_sum += distinct_count ** 2\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.sumCounts([1, 2, 1]))  # Output: 15\nprint(sol.sumCounts([1, 1]))     # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize `total_sum` to 0. This will hold the sum of the squares of the distinct counts of all subarrays.\n\n2. **Nested Loops**: We use two nested loops to generate all possible subarrays. The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, and the inner loop runs from `j = i` to `j = n-1`.\n\n3. **Distinct Count**: For each subarray `nums[i..j]`, we convert it to a set to get the distinct elements and then calculate its length, which gives us the distinct count.\n\n4. **Sum of Squares**: We square the distinct count and add it to `total_sum`.\n\n5. **Return Result**: After all subarrays are processed, we return `total_sum`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible subarrays and correctly compute the required sum of squares of distinct counts."], "input_token_count": 536, "output_token_counts": [565, 655, 669, 615, 616], "total_token_counts": [1101, 1191, 1205, 1151, 1152], "pass_rate": 1.0, "results": [true, true, true, true, true], "thinking_time": [94.0, 44.0, 139.0, 12.0, 16.0], "average_thinking_time": 51.333333333333336}

If it's still `-1`, it means no subsequence sums to the target, so return `-1`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lengthOfLongestSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        dp = [-1] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = 0  # The length of the longest subsequence that sums to 0 is 0\n        \n        for num in nums:\n            if num > target:\n                continue  # Skip numbers that are larger than the target\n            for i in range(target - num, -1, -1):\n                if dp[i] != -1:\n                    dp[i + num] = max(dp[i + num], dp[i] + 1)\n        \n        return dp[target]\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.lengthOfLongestSubsequence([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 9))  # Output: 3\nprint(sol.lengthOfLongestSubsequence([4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 5], 7))  # Output: 4\nprint(sol.lengthOfLongestSubsequence([1, 1, 5, 4, 5], 3))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through each number in `nums` and updates the `dp` array to keep track of the longest subsequence for each possible sum up to `target`. The final result is obtained from `dp[target]`.", " To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest subsequence that sums to a given target, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum length of a subsequence that sums to `j` using the first `i` elements of `nums`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(len(nums) + 1) x (target + 1)` initialized to `-1` to indicate that those states are not possible initially. Set `dp[0][0]` to `0` because a subsequence with 0 elements can sum to 0.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:\n   - Iterate over each element of `nums` and update the `dp` array.\n   - For each element `nums[i-1]`, update the `dp` array for all possible sums `j` from `0` to `target`.\n   - If `dp[i-1][j]` is not `-1`, it means it's possible to achieve sum `j` using the first `i-1` elements.\n   - For each possible sum `j`, if `dp[i-1][j] != -1`, we can either include `nums[i-1]` in the subsequence or not.\n   - If we include `nums[i-1]`, then `dp[i][j + nums[i-1]] = max(dp[i][j + nums[i-1]], dp[i-1][j] + 1)`.\n   - If we do not include `nums[i-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j])`.\n\n3. **Result Extraction**: The result will be the maximum value in the last row of the `dp` array that is not `-1` and is less than or equal to the target.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lengthOfLongestSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [[-1] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        dp[0][0] = 0\n        \n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            for j in range(target + 1):\n                if dp[i-1][j] != -1:\n                    # Do not include nums[i-1]\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j])\n                    # Include nums[i-1] if it does not exceed the target\n                    if j + nums[i-1] <= target:\n                        dp[i][j + nums[i-1]] = max(dp[i][j + nums[i-1]], dp[i-1][j] + 1)\n        \n        # Find the maximum length of subsequence that sums to target\n        result = -1\n        for j in range(target + 1):\n            if dp[n][j] != -1:\n                result = max(result, dp[n][j])\n        \n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.lengthOfLongestSubsequence([1,2,3,4,5], 9))  # Output: 3\nprint(sol.lengthOfLongestSubsequence([4,1,3,2,1,5], 7))  # Output: 4\nprint(sol.lengthOfLongestSubsequence([1,1,5,4,5], 3))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the length of the longest subsequence that sums to the target for the given constraints.", " To solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsequence in the given array `nums` that sums up to the target value. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We'll use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the maximum length of subsequences that sum up to the target.\n2. **DP Array**: We'll maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of a subsequence that sums up to `i`.\n3. **Initialization**: Initialize the `dp` array with `-1` to indicate that initially, no subsequence sums up to any value.\n4. **Update DP Array**: For each number in `nums`, update the `dp` array to reflect the maximum length of subsequences that can be formed by including the current number.\n5. **Result Extraction**: After processing all numbers, the value `dp[target]` will give us the length of the longest subsequence that sums up to the target.

Instead, we can use a more efficient approach by calculating the product of elements in each row and column separately and then combining these results to get the final product matrix.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def constructProductMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        n = len(grid)\n        m = len(grid[0])\n        MOD = 12345\n        \n        # Create prefix and suffix products for rows and columns\n        prefix_row = [[1] * m for _ in range(n)]\n        suffix_row = [[1] * m for _ in range(n)]\n        prefix_col = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]\n        suffix_col = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]\n        \n        # Calculate prefix products for rows\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if j > 0:\n                    prefix_row[i][j] = (prefix_row[i][j - 1] * grid[i][j]) % MOD\n                else:\n                    prefix_row[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n        \n        # Calculate suffix products for rows\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):\n                if j < m - 1:\n                    suffix_row[i][j] = (suffix_row[i][j + 1] * grid[i][j]) % MOD\n                else:\n                    suffix_row[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n        \n        # Calculate prefix products for columns\n        for j in range(m):\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i > 0:\n                    prefix_col[j][i] = (prefix_col[j][i - 1] * grid[i][j]) % MOD\n                else:\n                    prefix_col[j][i] = grid[i][j]\n        \n        # Calculate suffix products for columns\n        for j in range(m):\n            for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n                if i < n - 1:\n                    suffix_col[j][i] = (suffix_col[j][i + 1] * grid[i][j]) % MOD\n                else:\n                    suffix_col[j][i] = grid[i][j]\n        \n        # Construct the product matrix\n        p = [[1] * m for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if j > 0:\n                    p[i][j] = (prefix_row[i][j - 1] * suffix_row[i][j + 1]) % MOD\n                elif j < m - 1:\n                    p[i][j] = (suffix_row[i][j + 1]) % MOD\n                if i > 0:\n                    p[i][j] = (p[i][j] * prefix_col[j][i - 1]) % MOD\n                elif i < n - 1:\n                    p[i][j] = (p[i][j] * suffix_col[j][i + 1]) % MOD\n        \n        return p\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the product matrix by using prefix and suffix products for both rows and columns. This approach avoids division and handles large numbers by taking modulo `12345` at each step.", " To solve this problem, we need to construct a product matrix `p` where each element `p[i][j]` is the product of all elements in `grid` except for the element `grid[i][j]`, taken modulo `12345`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Product**: First, calculate the total product of all elements in the grid. This can be done by iterating through the grid and multiplying all elements together. Since the product can be very large, we take the result modulo `12345` at each step to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n2. **Construct the Product Matrix**: For each element `grid[i][j]` in the grid, calculate the product of all other elements. This can be done by dividing the total product by `grid[i][j]` and taking the result modulo `12345`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def constructProductMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        n = len(grid)\n        m = len(grid[0])\n        total_product = 1\n        mod = 12345\n        \n        # Calculate the total product of all elements in the grid\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                total_product = (total_product * grid[i][j]) % mod\n        \n        # Construct the product matrix\n        p = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                p[i][j] = (total_product * pow(grid[i][j], mod - 2, mod)) % mod\n        \n        return p\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Total Product Calculation**:\n   - We initialize `total_product` to 1.\n   - We iterate through each element in the grid and multiply it to `total_product`, taking the result modulo `12345` at each step.\n\n2. **Construct the Product Matrix**:\n   - We initialize a matrix `p` of the same size as `grid` with all elements set to 0.\n   - For each element `grid[i][j]`, we calculate `p[i][j]` as `(total_product * pow(grid[i][j], mod - 2, mod)) % mod`. This is done using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow and to ensure the result is within the required range.\n\n### Note:\n- The `pow` function with three arguments `pow(base, exp, mod)` computes `(base^exp) % mod`. This is used here to efficiently compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `grid[i][j]` modulo `12345`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the product matrix without directly multiplying large numbers, thus handling the constraints effectively."], "input_token_count": 732, "output_token_counts": [1010, 744, 749, 939, 677], "total_token_counts": [1742, 1476, 1481, 1671, 1409], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [78.0, 168.0, 190.0, 50.0, 42.0], "average_thinking_time": 98.66666666666667}

We create a copy of the current DP array `next_dp` and update it for each possible sum from `num` to `max_sum`.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: Finally, we sum up the values in the DP array from `l` to `r` and take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of valid sub-multisets with the given sum constraints.", " To solve the problem of counting sub-multisets with a bounded sum, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find all possible sub-multisets of `nums` such that the sum of the elements in each subset falls within the range `[l, r]`. A sub-multiset can contain elements multiple times, and the order of elements does not matter.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to count the number of valid sub-multisets. The idea is to use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a sum of `i`.\n\n3. **Handling Duplicates**: Since the elements can be repeated, we need to consider the frequency of each element in `nums`.

We start with `dp[0] = 1` because there's exactly one way to achieve a sum of 0 (the empty set).\n3. **DP Transition**: For each element in `nums`, we update the DP array to account for the current element. We use a new DP array `new_dp` to avoid overwriting the current state of `dp` during the update.\n4. **Summing Results**: Finally, we sum up all values in the DP array from `l` to `r` to get the total number of valid sub-multisets.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all possible sub-multisets with the given sum constraints.", " To solve the problem of counting sub-multisets with a bounded sum, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find all possible sub-multisets of `nums` such that the sum of the elements in each subset falls within the range `[l, r]`.

The goal is to make `s1` equal to `s2` with the minimum cost.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Flipping Operations**:\n   - We can flip two characters in `s1` at a cost of `x`.\n   - We can flip two adjacent characters in `s1` at a cost of `1`.\n\n2. **Impossible Case**:\n   - If the number of mismatched positions between `s1` and `s2` is odd, it is impossible to make them equal because each flip operation changes two positions.\n\n3. **Greedy Approach**:\n   - We need to minimize the cost of flipping operations.\n   - We can use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy approach to determine the minimum cost.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Count Mismatched Positions**:\n   - Traverse both strings and count the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ.\n\n2. **Calculate Cost**:\n   - If the number of mismatched positions is odd, return `-1` because each flip operation changes two positions.\n   - Use a greedy approach to calculate the minimum cost:\n     - Flip pairs of mismatched positions directly if the cost is less than `x`.\n     - Use the cost of flipping adjacent characters for the remaining mismatches.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, s1: str, s2: str, x: int) -> int:\n        mismatches = 0\n        n = len(s1)\n        \n        # Count mismatched positions\n        for i in range(n):\n            if s1[i] != s2[i]:\n                mismatches += 1\n        \n        # If the number of mismatches is odd, it's impossible to make the strings equal\n        if mismatches % 2 != 0:\n            return -1\n        \n        # If all characters are already equal\n        if mismatches == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Greedy approach to calculate the minimum cost\n        cost = 0\n        i = 0\n        while i < n:\n            if s1[i] != s2[i]:\n                # Try to flip the current pair directly if possible\n                if i + 1 < n and s1[i] != s1[i + 1] and s2[i] != s2[i + 1]:\n                    cost += min(x, 1)\n                    i += 2\n                else:\n                    # Otherwise, flip the current character\n                    cost += 1\n                    i += 1\n            else:\n                i += 1\n        \n        return cost\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minOperations(\"1100011000\", \"0101001010\", 2))  # Output: 4\nprint(sol.minOperations(\"10110\", \"00011\", 4))           # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Counting Mismatches**: We count the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ.\n- **Impossible Case**: If the number of mismatches is odd, return `-1`.\n- **Greedy Approach**: We iterate through the strings and use the available operations to minimize the cost.

The `right` pointer moves through the \"infinite\" array by using modulo operation (`right % n`).\n4. **Update Window Sum**: We add the current element to the window sum (`window_sum += nums[right % n]`).\n5. **Shrink Window**: If the window sum is greater than or equal to the target, we try to shrink the window from the left by subtracting the leftmost element (`window_sum -= nums[left % n]`) and moving the `left` pointer forward.\n6. **Update Minimum Length**: We keep track of the minimum length of the subarray found.\n7. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the minimum length if it's not `float('inf')`, otherwise return `-1`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the shortest subarray with the given sum in an infinitely repeated array.", " To solve the problem of finding the shortest subarray of the infinite array `infinite_nums` that sums to the target, we can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to simulate the infinite array by repeating the original array `nums` and then use a sliding window to find the smallest subarray whose sum equals the target.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Sum**: First, calculate the total sum of the array `nums`.

We'll maintain a window that slides across the array and calculates the sum of the elements within the window.\n\n3. **Handling the Infinite Repetition**: To handle the infinite repetition, we can use the modulo operation to simulate the infinite array.

If not, it's impossible to make the array empty.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Operations**: For elements that can be reduced by pairs or triples, calculate the minimum number of operations required to reduce them to zero.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each element\n        freq = Counter(nums)\n        \n        # Step 2: Check for validity and calculate operations\n        operations = 0\n        for count in freq.values():\n            if count % 2 != 0 and count % 3 != 0:\n                return -1\n            # Calculate the number of operations for each count\n            operations += count // 3\n            count %= 3\n            operations += count // 2\n        \n        return operations\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.minOperations([2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 4\n# print(sol.minOperations([2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]))          # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Counting Frequencies**: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array.\n2. **Checking Validity**: For each element's frequency, we check if it is not a multiple of 2 or 3. If it is not, we return `-1` because it's impossible to make the array empty.\n3. **Calculating Operations**: For each frequency, we calculate the number of operations required to reduce the frequency to zero. We use integer division to handle the removal of elements in groups of 3 first and then in groups of 2.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count and calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty.", " To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty. The operations allowed are:\n\n1. Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.\n2. Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.\n\nThe key observation here is that we can only delete elements if we have at least two elements of the same value for the first operation or at least three elements of the same value for the second operation.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will count the frequency of each element in the array and then use these frequencies to determine the minimum number of operations required.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each element in the array.\n2. For each unique element, check if we can use the first operation (two elements) or the second operation (three elements) to delete elements.\n3. If we can't delete elements using either operation, return `-1`.\n4. Otherwise, calculate the number of operations required based on the frequencies.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        freq = Counter(nums)\n        operations = 0\n        \n        for count in freq.values():\n            if count % 2 == 1 and count % 3 == 1:\n                return -1\n            operations += count // 2\n            count %= 2\n            operations += count // 3\n        \n        return operations\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Counting Frequencies**: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array.\n2. **Calculating Operations**:\n   - For each element's frequency, we first check if it's impossible to delete all elements using the given operations. If `count % 2 == 1 and count % 3 == 1`, it means we cannot form pairs of 2 or triplets of 3 to delete all elements, so we return `-1`.\n   - Otherwise, we add the number of operations required to delete elements using the first operation (`count // 2`).\n   - We then check if there are any remaining elements after using the first operation (`count % 2`).\n   - If there are any remaining elements, we use the second operation (`count // 3`) to delete them.\n3. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the total number of operations required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are using the minimum number of operations to make the array empty, if possible.", " To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty. The operations allowed are:\n\n1. Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.\n2. Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.\n\nThe key observation here is that we should always prefer to use the operation that removes two elements over the operation that removes three elements, because two elements are removed in one operation, while three elements require two operations.\n\nTo implement this, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each element in the array.\n2. For each unique element, determine the number of operations required to remove all instances of that element.\n3. If any element has a count that is not a multiple of 2 or 3, return `-1` because it's impossible to remove all elements.\n4.

It then iterates over the frequencies, checking if each frequency is a multiple of 2 or 3. If any frequency is not, it returns `-1`.

The smallest possible score for a subarray is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in that subarray. Therefore, our goal is to split the array such that each subarray has a score that is a multiple of the smallest possible score.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. Iterate through the array and maintain the current GCD of the subarray being formed.\n2. Whenever the current GCD becomes 0, we know that we need to start a new subarray because the GCD of an empty subarray is 0.\n3.

Whenever the AND value becomes 0, we start a new subarray.\n\nHere's the implementation of this approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        max_subarrays = 1\n        current_and = float('inf')  # Start with the maximum possible value\n        \n        for num in nums:\n            current_and &= num\n            if current_and == 0:\n                max_subarrays += 1\n                current_and = float('inf')  # Reset for the next subarray\n        \n        return max_subarrays\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.maxSubarrays([1,0,2,0,1,2]))  # Output: 3\nprint(sol.maxSubarrays([5,7,1,3]))      # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We start with `max_subarrays` set to 1 because the minimum number of subarrays is 1 (the array itself). We also initialize `current_and` to `float('inf')` to ensure that the first AND operation will always be less than this value.\n2. **Iteration**: We iterate through each element in the array, performing a bitwise AND with `current_and`.\n3. **Check for Zero**: If `current_and` becomes 0, it means we have found a subarray where the AND of all elements is 0. We then reset `current_and` to `float('inf')` and increment `max_subarrays` by 1 to start a new subarray.\n4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return `max_subarrays`, which represents the maximum number of subarrays that can be formed while ensuring the sum of their scores is minimized.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are always trying to maximize the number of subarrays while minimizing their scores."], "input_token_count": 599, "output_token_counts": [575, 703, 712, 742, 595], "total_token_counts": [1174, 1302, 1311, 1341, 1194], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [120.0, 56.0, 151.0, 145.0, 213.0], "average_thinking_time": 138.66666666666666}

If `nums[i] < nums[j]`, then `i` and `j` can be removed.\n2. **Count Remaining Elements**: After removing pairs, we need to count the remaining elements.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minLengthAfterRemovals(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        i = 0\n        j = n - 1\n        count = 0\n        \n        while i < j:\n            if nums[i] < nums[j]:\n                count += 2\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        \n        remaining = n - count\n        return remaining if remaining % 2 == 0 else remaining - 1\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minLengthAfterRemovals([1, 3, 4, 9]))  # Output: 0\nprint(sol.minLengthAfterRemovals([2, 3, 6, 9]))  # Output: 0\nprint(sol.minLengthAfterRemovals([1, 1, 2]))     # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize two pointers, `i` starting from the beginning of the array and `j` starting from the end of the array. We also initialize a `count` to keep track of the number of elements removed.\n2. **Loop Through Array**: We loop through the array using the two pointers. For each pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, if `nums[i] < nums[j]`, we increment the `count` by 2 because both elements can be removed.\n3. **Calculate Remaining Elements**: After the loop, we calculate the number of remaining elements as `n - count`. If the remaining count is even, it means we can potentially remove all elements. If it's odd, we need to remove one more element to make it even.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum length of the array after all possible operations."], "input_token_count": 794, "output_token_counts": [733, 644, 654, 610, 678], "total_token_counts": [1527, 1438, 1448, 1404, 1472], "pass_rate": 0.6, "results": [false, true, true, true, false], "thinking_time": [125.0, 114.0, 197.0, 68.0, 62.0], "average_thinking_time": 102.33333333333333}

If the characters are different and the index is even or odd, we add them to the respective lists.\n\n3. **Checking Parity**: Finally, we check if the lengths of the lists containing mismatched characters are even. If they are, it means we can swap the mismatched characters to make the strings equal, so we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine if the strings can be made equal by the given operations.", " To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can make the strings `s1` and `s2` equal by performing the given operation any number of times. The operation involves swapping characters at even-indexed positions with characters at even-indexed positions or odd-indexed positions with characters at odd-indexed positions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Mismatched Characters**: First, we need to identify the characters in `s1` and `s2` that are at the same positions but have different values. We can do this by iterating through the strings and comparing characters at each position.\n\n2. **Separate Characters by Parity**: We need to separate the mismatched characters into two groups: one group containing characters at even indices and the other group containing characters at odd indices. This is because the operation only allows swaps between characters at even and odd indices.\n\n3. **Check Swappability**: For each group, we need to check if the number of characters in one string that can be swapped to match the characters in the other string. This can be done by counting the frequency of each character and ensuring that the counts match.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: If both groups can be made equal through swaps, then the strings can be made equal.

This helps us in calculating the effective number of passes we need to make.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum**: Depending on whether the number of passes `k` is within the cycle or not, we calculate the sum `f(x)` accordingly.\n\n4. **Maximize the Sum**: Finally, we iterate through all possible starting players and find the one that maximizes `f(x)`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def getMaxFunctionValue(self, receiver: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(receiver)\n        visited = [False] * n\n        cycle_length = [0] * n\n        cycle_start = [-1] * n\n        cycle_index = [-1] * n\n        \n        # Find cycles\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not visited[i]:\n                current = i\n                path = []\n                while not visited[current]:\n                    visited[current] = True\n                    path.append(current)\n                    current = receiver[current]\n                if current in path:\n                    cycle_start[current] = current\n                    cycle_index[current] = 0\n                    cycle_length[current] = 1\n                    start_index = path.index(current)\n                    for j in range(start_index + 1, len(path)):\n                        cycle_start[path[j]] = current\n                        cycle_index[path[j]] = cycle_length[current]\n                        cycle_length[current] += 1\n                        current = receiver[current]\n                else:\n                    for node in path:\n                        visited[node] = False\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum value of f(x)\n        max_value = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if cycle_start[i] == -1:\n                # No cycle, direct calculation\n                current = i\n                value = i\n                for _ in range(k):\n                    current = receiver[current]\n                    value += current\n                max_value = max(max_value, value)\n            else:\n                # Cycle, find the position in the cycle\n                cycle_id = cycle_start[i]\n                pos = cycle_index[i]\n                cycle_length_val = cycle_length[cycle_id]\n                if k < cycle_length_val:\n                    # k is within the cycle\n                    current = i\n                    value = i\n                    for _ in range(k):\n                        current = receiver[current]\n                        value += current\n                    max_value = max(max_value, value)\n                else:\n                    # k is beyond the cycle, use the cycle properties\n                    remaining_passes = (k - pos) % cycle_length_val\n                    current = i\n                    value = i\n                    for _ in range(pos):\n                        current = receiver[current]\n                        value += current\n                    for _ in range(remaining_passes):\n                        current = receiver[current]\n                        value += current\n                    max_value = max(max_value, value)\n        \n        return max_value\n```\n\nThis code first identifies the cycles in the ball passing game and then calculates the maximum value of `f(x)` for each starting player, considering the cycles to optimize the computation.", " To solve this problem, we need to simulate the ball passing game and calculate the value of the function `f(x)` for each possible starting player `x`.

This helps in reducing the number of passes we need to simulate.\n\n3. **Simulate Passes**: If the starting player is within a cycle, we can simulate the passes within the cycle for up to `k` passes. If the cycle length is `L`, we only need to simulate up to `k % L` passes.\n\n4. **Calculate the Maximum Value**: For each possible starting player, calculate the value of `f(x)` and keep track of the maximum value encountered.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def getMaxFunctionValue(self, receiver: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(receiver)\n        visited = [False] * n\n        cycle_lengths = [0] * n\n        cycles = []\n        \n        # Find cycles and their lengths\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not visited[i]:\n                current = i\n                cycle_nodes = []\n                while not visited[current]:\n                    visited[current] = True\n                    cycle_nodes.append(current)\n                    current = receiver[current]\n                cycle_length = len(cycle_nodes)\n                cycle_lengths[i] = cycle_length\n                cycles.append(cycle_nodes)\n        \n        max_value = 0\n        \n        # For each starting player, calculate the value of f(x)\n        for start in range(n):\n            current = start\n            value = start\n            passes = k\n            \n            # Check if the player is in a cycle\n            if cycle_lengths[start] > 0:\n                cycle_index = cycle_nodes.index(start)\n                cycle_length = cycle_lengths[start]\n                passes %= cycle_length\n            \n            # Simulate the passes within the cycle\n            for _ in range(passes):\n                current = receiver[current]\n                value += current\n            \n            max_value = max(max_value, value)\n        \n        return max_value\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the cycle structure in the receiver array and only simulating the necessary passes.

A k-avoiding array is defined as an array where no two distinct elements sum up to `k`.\n\nTo achieve the minimum sum, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the smallest elements**: Start by including the smallest possible elements that do not violate the k-avoiding property.\n2. **Include complementary elements**: For each element `i` up to `k//2`, include both `i` and `k-i` in the array if they do not already exist in the array.\n3. **Fill the remaining elements**: Continue including the smallest available elements until the array reaches length `n`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above logic:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumSum(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:\n        elements = set()\n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        # Include elements from 1 to k//2 and their complements\n        for i in range(1, k // 2 + 1):\n            if i not in elements and (k - i) not in elements:\n                elements.add(i)\n                elements.add(k - i)\n        \n        # Include the remaining elements to reach length n\n        for i in range(1, k):\n            if len(elements) < n:\n                elements.add(i)\n        \n        # Calculate the total sum of the elements\n        total_sum = sum(elements)\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minimumSum(5, 4))  # Output: 18\nprint(sol.minimumSum(2, 6))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the smallest elements**: We iterate from `1` to `k//2` and include both `i` and `k-i` in the array if they are not already present. This ensures that no two elements sum up to `k`.\n2. **Include complementary elements**: By including both `i` and `k-i`, we ensure that the sum of any two elements does not equal `k`.\n3. **Fill the remaining elements**: After including the complementary pairs, we continue adding the smallest available elements until the array reaches length `n`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we get the minimum possible sum for a k-avoiding array of length `n`.", " To solve this problem, we need to construct a k-avoiding array of length `n` with the minimum possible sum. A k-avoiding array is one where no two distinct elements sum to `k`.\n\nThe strategy to achieve the minimum sum is to use the smallest possible numbers first, ensuring that we do not pair them to sum up to `k`. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialize the sum**: Start with a sum of 0.\n2. **Iterate through possible numbers**: Use the smallest numbers first and add them to the sum.\n3. **Avoid pairing**: Ensure that the numbers added do not form pairs that sum to `k`.\n4. **Stop when the array is of length `n`**: Continue until the array has `n` elements.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumSum(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize the sum\n        total_sum = 0\n        # Start with the smallest number\n        current_number = 1\n        \n        # Iterate until we have n elements in the array\n        while n > 0:\n            # If the current number and the number to form a pair with k, skip it\n            if current_number + (k - current_number) <= k:\n                total_sum += current_number\n                n -= 1\n            # Move to the next number\n            current_number += 1\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minimumSum(5, 4))  # Output: 18\nprint(sol.minimumSum(2, 6))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We start with `total_sum` set to 0 and `current_number` set to 1.\n- **Loop**: We continue adding the smallest possible numbers to the sum until we have `n` elements in the array.\n- **Avoidance of Pairs**: For each number added, we check if adding it would form a pair with another number to sum to `k`. If it does, we skip that number.\n- **Termination**: The loop terminates when we have added `n` numbers to the sum.\n\nThis approach ensures that we use the smallest numbers possible without forming pairs that sum to `k`, thus achieving the minimum possible sum for the k-avoiding array.", " To solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of a k-avoiding array of length `n`, we need to ensure that no two distinct elements in the array sum up to `k`. The strategy involves filling the array with the smallest possible distinct positive integers while adhering to this constraint.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the smallest elements**: Start with the smallest positive integers.\n2. **Avoid pairs summing to `k`**: Ensure that the sum of any two distinct elements does not equal `k`.\n3. **Calculate the sum**: Keep adding the smallest possible integers until the array reaches length `n`.\n\nThe smallest integers are `1, 2, 3, ...`. To avoid pairs summing to `k`, we can use numbers up to `k-1` and then use numbers greater than `k` to fill the rest of the array.\n\nFor example, if `k = 4`, the smallest numbers are `1, 2, 3`. We can include `1, 2, 3` in our array and then continue with numbers greater than `4` (i.e., `5, 6, ...`).\n\nThe sum of the first `k-1` numbers plus the sum of the remaining numbers will give us the minimum sum.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumSum(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:\n        # Sum of the first k-1 numbers\n        sum_first_k_minus_1 = (k * (k - 1)) // 2\n        \n        # Numbers greater than k\n        remaining_numbers = n - (k - 1)\n        \n        # Sum of the remaining numbers\n        sum_remaining = sum(range(k + 1, k + remaining_numbers))\n        \n        # Total sum\n        return sum_first_k_minus_1 + sum_remaining\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minimumSum(5, 4))  # Output: 18\nprint(sol.minimumSum(2, 6))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sum of the first `k-1` numbers**: This is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\(\\frac{(k-1) \\cdot k}{2}\\).\n2. **Remaining numbers**: After including the first `k-1` numbers, we need to include `n - (k - 1)` more numbers.\n3. **Sum of the remaining numbers**: These numbers start from `k+1` and go up to `k + (n - (k - 1))`.\n\nBy combining these sums, we get the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length `n`."], "input_token_count": 350, "output_token_counts": [670, 716, 561, 549, 647], "total_token_counts": [1020, 1066, 911, 899, 997], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [82.0, 72.0, 69.0, 76.0, 49.0], "average_thinking_time": 72.33333333333333}

This will allow us to quickly find the closest element to the current element by using binary search.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Array**: For each element in the array, we'll check the sorted list to find the minimum absolute difference.\n\n3. **Update the Sorted List**: After processing each element, we'll add the current element to the sorted list if it meets the index requirement.\n\n4. **Binary Search for Closest Element**: To find the closest element to the current element, we'll use binary search on the sorted list.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nimport bisect\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minAbsoluteDifference(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        if x == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Initialize the sorted list with the first element\n        sorted_list = []\n        min_diff = float('inf')\n        \n        for i in range(x, len(nums)):\n            # Add the current element to the sorted list\n            bisect.insort(sorted_list, nums[i - x])\n            \n            # Find the closest element in the sorted list to nums[i]\n            idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_list, nums[i])\n            \n            if idx > 0:\n                min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(nums[i] - sorted_list[idx - 1]))\n            if idx < len(sorted_list):\n                min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(nums[i] - sorted_list[idx]))\n        \n        return min_diff\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty list `sorted_list` and set `min_diff` to infinity.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the array starting from index `x` to the end of the array.\n\n3. **Insert and Sort**: For each element `nums[i]`, we insert `nums[i - x]` into `sorted_list` using `bisect.insort`. This maintains the sorted order of the list.\n\n4. **Binary Search**: We use `bisect.bisect_left` to find the position where `nums[i]` would be inserted in the sorted list. This position helps us find the closest elements in the sorted list to `nums[i]`.\n\n5. **Calculate Minimum Difference**: We calculate the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and the closest elements in the sorted list and update `min_diff` if a smaller difference is found.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the minimum difference found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum absolute difference while maintaining the constraint that the indices are at least `x` apart."], "input_token_count": 569, "output_token_counts": [459, 829, 810, 685, 733], "total_token_counts": [1028, 1398, 1379, 1254, 1302], "pass_rate": 0.6, "results": [true, false, false, true, true], "thinking_time": [135.0, 151.0, 257.0, 243.0, 149.0], "average_thinking_time": 181.0}

Otherwise, we return `false`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above logic:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def canSplitArray(self, nums: List[int], m: int) -> bool:\n        n = len(nums)\n        \n        # Base case: if the array has only one element, return true\n        if n == 1:\n            return True\n        \n        # Helper function to check if a subarray satisfies the conditions\n        def is_valid_split(subarray):\n            for num in subarray:\n                if num >= m:\n                    return True\n            return False\n        \n        # Recursive function to try all possible splits\n        def can_split(nums):\n            n = len(nums)\n            if n == 1:\n                return True\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                left = nums[:i]\n                right = nums[i:]\n                if is_valid_split(left) and is_valid_split(right) and can_split(left) and can_split(right):\n                    return True\n            return False\n        \n        return can_split(nums)\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible ways to split the array.

Continue this process until you have selected `k` items.\n\n4. **Calculate Elegance**: For each step, calculate the elegance of the current subsequence and keep track of the maximum elegance encountered.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findMaximumElegance(self, items: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:\n        # Sort items by profit in descending order, and by category in ascending order if profits are equal\n        items.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))\n        \n        # Select the first k items\n        selected = items[:k]\n        total_profit = sum(item[0] for item in selected)\n        distinct_categories = len(set(item[1] for item in selected))\n        max_elegance = total_profit + distinct_categories ** 2\n        \n        # Use a set to keep track of categories already in the subsequence\n        category_set = set(item[1] for item in selected)\n        \n        # Iterate through the remaining items\n        for i in range(k, len(items)):\n            profit, category = items[i]\n            if category not in category_set:\n                # Replace the worst item in the selected subsequence with the current item\n                worst_profit, worst_category = selected[-1]\n                if worst_category != category:\n                    # Replace the worst item with the current item\n                    selected[-1] = items[i]\n                    total_profit = total_profit - worst_profit + profit\n                    category_set.remove(worst_category)\n                    category_set.add(category)\n                    distinct_categories = len(category_set)\n                    max_elegance = max(max_elegance, total_profit + distinct_categories ** 2)\n        \n        return max_elegance\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.findMaximumElegance([[3,2],[5,1],[10,1]], 2))  # Output: 17\n# print(sol.findMaximumElegance([[3,1],[3,1],[2,2],[5,3]], 3))  # Output: 19\n# print(sol.findMaximumElegance([[1,1],[2,1],[3,1]], 3))  # Output: 7\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Sorting**: The items are sorted by profit in descending order and by category in ascending order if profits are equal.\n2. **Initial Selection**: The first `k` items are selected, and the initial total profit and distinct categories are calculated.\n3. **Greedy Optimization**: For each remaining item, if it has a different category from the last item in the current subsequence, it is added to the subsequence, and the total profit and distinct categories are updated.\n4. **Elegance Calculation**: The elegance is calculated as `total_profit + distinct_categories^2` and the maximum elegance is tracked throughout the process.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the elegance by always replacing the least beneficial item with a higher profit item from a different category when necessary.", " To solve the problem of finding the maximum elegance of a subsequence of size `k` from the given `items`, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sort the Items**: First, sort the items based on their profit in descending order. If two items have the same profit, sort them based on their category in ascending order. This helps in selecting the highest profit items first and ensures that we consider categories with lower indices first.\n\n2. **Select the Initial Subsequence**: Use a greedy approach to select the first `k` items from the sorted list. These items will form our initial subsequence.\n\n3. **Calculate Initial Elegance**: Calculate the initial elegance of this subsequence. The elegance is given by `total_profit + distinct_categories^2`.\n\n4. **Iteratively Replace Items**: To maximize the elegance, we need to consider replacing items from the initial subsequence with items that have higher profits but belong to different categories. We will use a priority queue (max heap) to keep track of the items that can be potentially added to the subsequence.\n\n5. **Update Elegance**: For each replacement, calculate the new elegance and update the maximum elegance if the new value is higher.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing the above approach:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findMaximumElegance(self, items: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:\n        # Sort items by profit in descending order, and by category in ascending order if profits are equal\n        items.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))\n        \n        # Select the first k items for the initial subsequence\n        initial_subseq = items[:k]\n        total_profit = sum(item[0] for item in initial_subseq)\n        distinct_categories = len(set(item[1] for item in initial_subseq))\n        initial_elegance = total_profit + distinct_categories ** 2\n        \n        # Use a max heap to keep track of the items that can be potentially added\n        heap = []\n        \n        # Add all items that are not in the initial subsequence to the heap\n        for i in range(k, len(items)):\n            if items[i][1] not in set(item[1] for item in initial_subseq):\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (-items[i][0], items[i][1]))\n        \n        # Try to replace items in the initial subsequence with items from the heap\n        for i in range(k):\n            if heap and initial_subseq[i][1] in seen_categories:\n                current_profit, current_category = initial_subseq[i]\n                heap_profit, heap_category = heapq.heappop(heap)\n                new_total_profit = total_profit - current_profit + (-heap_profit)\n                new_distinct_categories = distinct_categories - (current_category != heap_category) + 1\n                new_elegance = new_total_profit + new_distinct_categories ** 2\n                initial_elegance = max(initial_elegance, new_elegance)\n        \n        return initial_elegance\n\n# Example usage:\n# items = [[3,2],[5,1],[10,1]], k = 2\n# print(Solution().findMaximumElegance(items, k))  # Output: 17\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sorting**: The items are sorted by profit in descending order and by category in ascending order if profits are equal. This ensures that we consider the highest profit items first and then the lowest category numbers.\n\n2. **Initial Subsequence**: The first `k` items are selected for the initial subsequence.\n\n3. **Initial Elegance Calculation**: The initial elegance is calculated using the formula `total_profit + distinct_categories^2`.\n\n4. **Heap for Potential Replacements**: A max heap is used to keep track of items that can be potentially added to the subsequence. Only items from categories not already in the initial subsequence are considered.\n\n5. **Replacing Items**: For each item in the initial subsequence, if there is a better item available in the heap, we replace it and recalculate the elegance.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the elegance by considering all possible subsequences of size `k` and updating the maximum elegance accordingly."], "input_token_count": 863, "output_token_counts": [909, 835, 929, 914, 979], "total_token_counts": [1772, 1698, 1792, 1777, 1842], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [90.0, 209.0, 196.0, 99.0, 87.0], "average_thinking_time": 128.33333333333334}

Therefore, if `nums` has `n + 1` elements, it can be a permutation of `base[n]`.\n3. **Count Occurrences**: Ensure that the elements in `nums` match the pattern of `base[n]`. Specifically, `1` to `n-1` should each appear exactly once, and `n` should appear exactly twice.\n\nLet's implement this logic in the function `isGood`:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def isGood(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        nums_counter = Counter(nums)\n        max_num = max(nums)\n        n = len(nums)\n        \n        # Check if the length of nums is n + 1\n        if n != max_num + 1:\n            return False\n        \n        # Check the counts of each number\n        for num in range(1, max_num):\n            if nums_counter[num] != 1:\n                return False\n        if nums_counter[max_num] != 2:\n            return False\n        \n        return True\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.isGood([2, 1, 3]))  # Output: False\nprint(sol.isGood([1, 3, 3, 2]))  # Output: True\nprint(sol.isGood([1, 1]))  # Output: True\nprint(sol.isGood([3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Counter**: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `nums`.\n2. **Maximum Element**: We find the maximum element in `nums` to determine `n`.\n3. **Length Check**: We check if the length of `nums` is `n + 1`.\n4. **Count Validation**: We validate that each number from `1` to `n-1` appears exactly once and that `n` appears exactly twice.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify whether `nums` is a good array according to the given definition.", " Here's the implementation of the `isGood` function in Python:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def isGood(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        nums_counter = Counter(nums)\n        max_num = max(nums)\n        \n        # Check if the length of nums is max_num + 1\n        if len(nums) != max_num + 1:\n            return False\n        \n        # Check if the count of max_num is exactly 2\n        if nums_counter[max_num] != 2:\n            return False\n        \n        # Check if all other numbers have a count of exactly 1\n        for i in range(1, max_num):\n            if nums_counter[i] != 1:\n                return False\n        \n        return True\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the length of the `nums` array is `max_num + 1`. Then, it checks if the count of the maximum number in the array is exactly 2. Finally, it verifies that all other numbers appear exactly once.

If `n` becomes negative or we run out of numbers to consider, we return 0.\n\n4. **Recursive Case**: For each number starting from 1, we either include it in the sum or exclude it, and recursively call the function with the updated `n`.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we'll take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfWays(self, n: int, x: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        \n        # Memoization dictionary to store results of subproblems\n        memo = {}\n        \n        def helper(n, x, start):\n            if (n, x, start) in memo:\n                return memo[(n, x, start)]\n            \n            if n == 0:\n                return 1\n            if n < 0 or start > n:\n                return 0\n            \n            # Include the current number in the sum\n            include = helper(n - start**x, x, start + 1)\n            \n            # Exclude the current number from the sum\n            exclude = helper(n, x, start + 1)\n            \n            # Store the result in memo dictionary\n            memo[(n, x, start)] = (include + exclude) % MOD\n            return memo[(n, x, start)]\n        \n        return helper(n, x, 1)\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.numberOfWays(10, 2))  # Output: 1\nprint(sol.numberOfWays(4, 1))   # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **MOD**: We define a constant `MOD` for the modulo operation to keep the result within the required range.\n- **memo**: A dictionary to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n- **helper function**: This function recursively explores all possible combinations of unique integers that sum up to `n` when raised to the power of `x`.\n  - **Base Case**: If `n` is zero, we return 1 (indicating a valid combination). If `n` is negative or we've exhausted possible numbers, we return 0.\n  - **Recursive Case**: We consider two possibilities for each number: including it in the sum or excluding it. We then store the result in the memo dictionary and return it.\n- **Initial Call**: We start the recursion with `n`, `x`, and `start` as 1.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible combinations efficiently and handle the large result sizes using modulo arithmetic.", " To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to find all possible combinations of unique integers whose `xth` power sums up to `n`. We can use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to express `i` as the sum of the `xth` power of the first `j` unique integers.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Generate the list of possible powers**: First, we need to generate a list of integers whose `xth` power is less than or equal to `n`. This can be done by iterating from 1 and calculating the `xth` power until it exceeds `n`.\n\n2. **Initialize the DP table**: We initialize a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the number of ways to express `i` using the first `j` unique integers.\n\n3. **Fill the DP table**: We iterate over each possible sum `i` from 0 to `n` and each number of unique integers `j` from 1 to the length of our list of powers. For each combination, we decide whether to include the `jth` power or not.\n\n4. **Return the result**: The value at `dp[n][len(powers)]` will give us the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of the `xth` power of unique integers.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfWays(self, n: int, x: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        # Generate the list of possible powers\n        powers = []\n        i = 1\n        while i**x <= n:\n            powers.append(i**x)\n            i += 1\n        \n        # Initialize the DP table\n        dp = [[0] * (len(powers) + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        \n        # Fill the DP table\n        for j in range(len(powers) + 1):\n            dp[0][j] = 1  # There's one way to express 0 (using no numbers)\n        \n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            for j in range(1, len(powers) + 1):\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]  # Exclude the jth power\n                if i >= powers[j - 1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - powers[j - 1]][j - 1]) % MOD\n        \n        return dp[n][len(powers)]\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.numberOfWays(10, 2))  # Output: 1\nprint(sol.numberOfWays(4, 1))   # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of the `xth` power of unique positive integers, returning the result modulo `10^9 + 7`."], "input_token_count": 441, "output_token_counts": [620, 547, 758, 772, 725], "total_token_counts": [1061, 988, 1199, 1213, 1166], "pass_rate": 1.0, "results": [true, true, true, true, true], "thinking_time": [135.0, 152.0, 194.0, 57.0, 66.0], "average_thinking_time": 117.66666666666667}

We increment the count at the start of the range and decrement it at the end of the range (one position after the end to handle the range correctly).\n3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We calculate the prefix sum of the counts to get the actual count of elements in each range.\n4. **Track Maximum Length**: We iterate through the sorted unique numbers and keep track of the maximum count of elements in any range.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count and track the number of elements in each possible range, leading to an optimal solution.", " To solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array after applying operations, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation**:\n   - For each element at index `i`, we can replace it with any value in the range `[nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k]`.\n   - This means we can adjust each element to be within a range of `2k` units around its original value.\n\n2. **Beauty of the Array**:\n   - The beauty of the array is defined as the length of the longest subsequence consisting of equal elements.\n   - A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We need to determine the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by applying the allowed operations.\n   - This can be approached by considering the range of possible values for each element after applying the operations.\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each unique element in the array, determine the range of values it can take after applying the operations.\n   - Count how many elements fall within each range.\n   - The maximum count of elements within any range will give the maximum beauty of the array.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Create a set to store unique elements\n        unique_nums = list(set(nums))\n        # Sort the unique elements\n        unique_nums.sort()\n        \n        max_beauty = 0\n        \n        for num in unique_nums:\n            # Calculate the range of values for each element\n            lower_bound = num - k\n            upper_bound = num + k\n            # Count how many elements fall within this range\n            count = sum(1 for x in nums if lower_bound <= x <= upper_bound)\n            # Update the maximum beauty\n            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, count)\n        \n        return max_beauty\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Unique Elements**:\n   - We first convert the list `nums` to a set to get unique elements and then convert it back to a list and sort it.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Unique Elements**:\n   - For each unique element, we calculate the range `[num - k, num + k]` within which we can adjust the element.\n\n3. **Count Elements in Range**:\n   - We count how many elements from the original array `nums` fall within this range.\n\n4. **Update Maximum Beauty**:\n   - We keep track of the maximum count of elements that can be made equal within any range.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum beauty of the array after applying the operations. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), and the subsequent linear scan, which is \\(O(n)\\). Therefore, the overall time complexity is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), which is suitable for the given constraints.", " To solve this problem, we need to maximize the length of the longest subsequence consisting of equal elements after applying the given operation any number of times.

This ensures that we have applied the operation `t` times, maximizing the difference between `x` and `num` by `2 * t`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def theMaximumAchievableX(self, num: int, t: int) -> int:\n        return num + 2 * t\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.theMaximumAchievableX(4, 1))  # Output: 6\nprint(sol.theMaximumAchievableX(3, 2))  # Output: 7\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the given `num` and `t`.\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: The maximum difference that can be achieved after `t` operations is `2 * t`.\n3. **Calculation**: To find the maximum achievable number `x`, we add `2 * t` to `num`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are maximizing the number of operations to achieve the maximum difference, thus finding the largest possible `x` that can be made equal to `num`.", " To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum achievable number `x` that can be made equal to `num` after applying the given operation at most `t` times. The operation involves either increasing or decreasing both `x` and `num` by 1 in each step.\n\nThe key observation here is that each operation reduces the difference between `x` and `num` by 2 (since both `x` and `num` are changed by 1). Therefore, if we start with `num` and perform the operation `t` times, the maximum achievable number `x` will be `num + 2 * t`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1.

The mathematical reasoning behind this solution is that each operation reduces the difference by 2, so after `t` operations, the difference will be `2 * t`, and adding this to `num` gives the maximum achievable number.", " To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum achievable number `x` that can be made equal to `num` after applying the given operation at most `t` times. The operation allows us to either increase or decrease `x` by `1`, and simultaneously increase or decrease `num` by `1`.\n\nThe key observation here is that each operation reduces the difference between `x` and `num` by `2` (since both `x` and `num` are changed by `1`). Therefore, if the initial difference between `num` and `x` is `d`, we can perform `t` operations to reduce this difference to `0`.\n\nThe initial difference `d` is `|num - x|`. After `t` operations, the difference will be `d - 2t`. To make `x` equal to `num`, we need this difference to be `0`. Hence, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ d - 2t = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for `x`, we get:\n\n\\[ x = num + 2t \\]\n\nThis formula gives us the maximum achievable number `x` after `t` operations.\n\nLet's implement this in the given Python function signature:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def theMaximumAchievableX(self, num: int, t: int) -> int:\n        return num + 2 * t\n```\n\nThis function calculates the maximum achievable number `x` by adding `2 * t` to `num`. This is because each operation reduces the difference by `2`, and we need to reduce the difference to `0` in `t` operations.", " To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum achievable number `x` that can be made equal to `num` after applying the given operation at most `t` times.

Therefore, if we start with a difference of `d` between `x` and `num`, we can perform `t` operations to reduce this difference to `0`.\n\nThe initial difference between `x` and `num` is `|x - num|`. After `t` operations, the difference will be reduced to `|x - num - 2*t|`. To maximize `x`, we want to minimize the difference, which means we should set `x` to be `num + 2*t`.\n\nHere's the implementation of this logic:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def theMaximumAchievableX(self, num: int, t: int) -> int:\n        return num + 2 * t\n```\n\nThis function simply calculates the maximum achievable number `x` by adding `2*t` to the given `num`.

Initially, this target sum is the sum of all elements in `nums`.\n3. **Simulate Operations**: Iterate through the array and for each element, check if it can be reduced by 1 (i.e., if the current element is less than or equal to the target sum). If it can be reduced, update the target sum accordingly. If it cannot be reduced (i.e., the current element is greater than the target sum), return `false`.\n4. **Update Target Sum**: After processing each element, update the target sum by subtracting the number of operations performed (which is the number of elements in the subarray).\n5. **Check Completion**: If the target sum becomes zero, return `true`.

Therefore, we need to find the smallest number of such operations that can reduce `num1` to `0`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Check if the operation is possible**: The value `2^i + num2` must be such that the sum of these values over `k` operations is at least `num1`. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (2^i + num2) \\geq num1\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i + k \\cdot num2 \\geq num1\n   \\]\n   The sum of the geometric series \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i\\) is \\(2^k - 1\\).

If no feasible `i` is found, return `-1`.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def makeTheIntegerZero(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:\n        for i in range(61):\n            value_to_subtract = 2**i + num2\n            if num1 - i * value_to_subtract <= 0:\n                if num1 - i * value_to_subtract == 0 or (i < 60 and num1 - (i + 1) * value_to_subtract > 0):\n                    return i\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.makeTheIntegerZero(3, -2))  # Output: 3\nprint(sol.makeTheIntegerZero(5, 7))   # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loop through possible values of `i`**: We iterate from `0` to `60` because `i` can range from `0` to `60`.\n2. **Calculate the value to subtract**: For each `i`, we calculate `2^i + num2`.\n3. **Check feasibility**:\n   - If `num1 - i * value_to_subtract` is less than or equal to zero, it means we can potentially make `num1` zero in `i` operations.\n   - Additionally, we need to ensure that `num1` is not exactly zero after `i` operations and is positive after `i + 1` operations.\n4. **Return the result**: If we find a feasible `i`, we return it. If no feasible `i` is found after the loop, we return `-1`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we check all possible values of `i` and find the minimum number of operations required to make `num1` zero, if possible."], "input_token_count": 477, "output_token_counts": [745, 815, 840, 741, 695], "total_token_counts": [1222, 1292, 1317, 1218, 1172], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [221.0, 137.0, 118.0, 97.0, 246.0], "average_thinking_time": 158.66666666666666}

The length will be `2 * min(x, y)` if `x` and `y` are not equal, or `2 * x` if they are equal.\n- **Handling Unequal Counts**: If `x` and `y` are not equal, we can add one more \"A\" or \"B\" to the end to break the tie.\n- **Adding \"AB\" and \"BA\"**: We add `2 * z` to account for the \"AB\" and \"BA\" strings.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the length of the resulting string without forming the forbidden substrings \"AAA\" or \"BBB\".", " To solve this problem, we need to maximize the length of the resulting string while ensuring that it does not contain \"AAA\" or \"BBB\" as substrings.

This helps in avoiding redundant calculations by storing the results of function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.\n\n2. **Recursive Function `dp`**:\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `index`: The current word index.\n     - `current_str`: The current concatenated string.\n     - `last_char`: The last character of the current string.\n   - **Base Case**: When `index` equals the length of `words`, we return the length of `current_str` because we have processed all words.\n   - **Recursive Case**:\n     - **Option 1**: Concatenate `current_str` with `next_word` and call `dp` with the next index, the new concatenated string, and the last character of `next_word`.\n     - **Option 2**: Concatenate `next_word` with `current_str` and call `dp` with the next index, the new concatenated string, and the first character of `current_str`.\n   - **Return the Minimum**: We return the minimum length between the two options.\n\n3. **Initial Call**: We start the recursion with the first word as the initial string, the first character of the first word as the initial last character, and the index as 1 (since we start from the second word).\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible ways to concatenate the words and find the minimum length of the final string.", " To solve the problem of minimizing the length of the final concatenated string, we need to consider the order of concatenations and how the last character of one word interacts with the first character of the next word.

However, the minimum cost to collect all types will always be the minimum cost of collecting any single type, because we can always perform operations to make the cost of collecting any type as low as the minimum cost.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation**: Each operation changes the type of all chocolates to the next index in a circular manner. For example, if we have 3 chocolates initially, the operation will change their types to [1, 2, 0] or [2, 0, 1] depending on the number of times we perform the operation.\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost for Each Type**: For each chocolate type, calculate the total cost to collect all types starting from that type.

Each operation can potentially reduce the cost of collecting some chocolates.\n\n3. **Minimum Cost Calculation**: We need to find the minimum cost to collect all types of chocolates. This can be done by considering the cost of each chocolate after performing the operations and choosing the optimal sequence of operations.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to collect chocolates of each type after performing a certain number of operations.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        # Initialize the minimum cost to collect each chocolate type\n        min_cost = [float('inf')] * n\n        \n        # Initial cost to collect each chocolate type\n        for i in range(n):\n            min_cost[i] = nums[i]\n        \n        # Perform operations to find the minimum cost\n        for _ in range(n):\n            new_cost = [0] * n\n            for i in range(n):\n                new_cost[i] = min(nums[i], min_cost[(i + 1) % n])\n            min_cost = [min(min_cost[i], new_cost[i]) for i in range(n)]\n            # Add the cost of performing the operation\n            for i in range(n):\n                min_cost[i] += x\n        \n        # The final cost is the sum of the minimum costs after all operations\n        return sum(min_cost)\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minCost([20, 1, 15], 5))  # Output: 13\nprint(sol.minCost([1, 2, 3], 4))    # Output: 6\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize `min_cost` with the initial costs of collecting each chocolate type.\n\n2. **Perform Operations**: We perform the operation `n` times (since after `n` operations, the types will cycle back to the original state).

This involves determining the minimum number of operations needed to collect each type of chocolate.\n\n3. **Minimize the Cost**: For each chocolate type, compute the cost of collecting it directly and the cost of collecting it after performing the operations. The minimum of these two costs will be the cost of collecting that type of chocolate.\n\n4. **Sum the Costs**: Sum the minimum costs for all chocolate types to get the total minimum cost.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        min_costs = nums[:]  # Initialize min_costs with the initial costs\n        \n        # Perform operations and calculate the minimum costs\n        for _ in range(n):\n            for i in range(n):\n                next_type = (i + 1) % n\n                min_costs[i] = min(min_costs[i], nums[next_type])\n        \n        # Sum the minimum costs for all chocolate types\n        total_cost = sum(min_costs) + x * (len(nums) - 1)\n        return total_cost\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.minCost([20, 1, 15], 5))  # Output: 13\n# print(sol.minCost([1, 2, 3], 4))     # Output: 6\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `min_costs` with the initial costs of the chocolates.\n\n2. **Perform Operations**: We perform the operations by cycling through the indices.

We also add the cost of performing the operations, which is `x * (len(nums) - 1)` because we perform the operation `n-1` times to cycle through all types.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimum cost to collect all types of chocolates by leveraging the cyclic nature of the operations.", " To solve this problem, we need to minimize the total cost of collecting chocolates of all types.

The cost of this operation is `x`.\n\n2. **Cost Calculation**: For each chocolate type, we need to calculate the minimum cost to collect all types.

For each row, we can check if it can be part of a good subset by checking if any of the previously seen rows can form a good subset with it.\n\n5. **Implementation**: We will iterate through each row, check if it can form a good subset with any of the previously seen rows, and store the valid rows in a result list.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n        seen = {}\n        \n        # Convert each row to its binary representation\n        for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n            binary_row = 0\n            for j, val in enumerate(row):\n                binary_row |= (val << j)\n            \n            # Check if the row itself is a good subset\n            if binary_row == 0:\n                return [i]\n            \n            # Check if the row can be part of a good subset with any previously seen row\n            for k in seen:\n                if (binary_row & k) == 0:\n                    return [seen[k], i]\n            \n            # Store the row if it can form a good subset with other rows\n            for k in seen:\n                if (binary_row & k) == 0:\n                    continue\n            seen[binary_row] = i\n        \n        return []\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix([[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]))  # Output: [0,1]\nprint(sol.goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix([[0]]))  # Output: [0]\nprint(sol.goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix([[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]))  # Output: []\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Binary Conversion**: Each row is converted to a binary number where each bit represents the presence of a 1 in the corresponding column.\n2. **Self-Check**: If a row has all zeros (binary 0), it is a good subset by itself.\n3. **Subset Check**: For each row, we check if it can form a good subset with any previously seen row by performing a bitwise AND operation. If the result is 0, it means the rows can form a good subset.\n4. **Storing Results**: We store each row in a hash set and check if it can form a good subset with any previously stored row.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find a good subset of rows without generating all possible subsets, making it suitable for large matrices.", " To solve this problem, we need to find a subset of rows from the given binary matrix `grid` such that the sum of each column in the subset is at most half the length of the subset. Given the constraints, we know that the number of columns `n` is at most 5, which allows us to use a brute-force approach to check all possible subsets.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Iterate through all possible subsets**: Since the number of rows `m` can be up to 10^4, we need to consider subsets of rows. Given the small number of columns, we can use a bitmask approach to generate all possible subsets.\n2. **Check the condition for each subset**: For each subset, calculate the sum of each column and check if it satisfies the condition that the sum is at most half the length of the subset.\n3. **Return the indices of the good subset**: If a good subset is found, return the indices of the rows in the subset.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n        \n        # Create a dictionary to store the sum of each column for each subset\n        col_sums = {}\n        \n        # Iterate through all possible subsets\n        for mask in range(1, 1 << m):\n            subset_sum = [0] * n\n            subset_len = 0\n            \n            # Calculate the sum of each column for the current subset\n            for i in range(m):\n                if mask & (1 << i):\n                    subset_len += 1\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        subset_sum[j] += grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Check if the subset is good\n            is_good = True\n            for j in range(n):\n                if subset_sum[j] > (subset_len // 2):\n                    is_good = False\n                    break\n            \n            if is_good:\n                # Store the indices of the subset\n                indices = [i for i in range(m) if mask & (1 << i)]\n                return sorted(indices)\n        \n        # If no good subset is found, return an empty array\n        return []\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix([[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]))  # Output: [0,1]\nprint(sol.goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix([[0]]))  # Output: [0]\nprint(sol.goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix([[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]))  # Output: []\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Bitmask Approach**: We use a bitmask to represent each subset of rows. The bitmask `mask` has a length of `m` (number of rows), and each bit indicates whether the corresponding row is included in the subset.\n2. **Subset Sum Calculation**: For each bitmask, we calculate the sum of each column in the subset.\n3. **Good Subset Check**: We check if the sum of each column in the subset is at most half the length of the subset.\n4. **Return Indices**: If a good subset is found, we return the indices of the rows in the subset sorted in ascending order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we check all possible subsets and find a good subset if it exists.

When we encounter a character, we check if it has a counterpart (a similar character) on the stack. If it does, we remove both the character and its counterpart from the stack.\n3. **Count Remaining Characters**: After all possible removals, the size of the stack will give us the minimized length of the string.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minimizedStringLength(self, s: str) -> int:\n        stack = []\n        \n        for char in s:\n            if stack and stack[-1] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                stack.append(char)\n        \n        return len(stack)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty stack.\n2. **Iteration**: We iterate through each character in the string `s`.\n3. **Stack Operations**:\n   - If the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is the same as the current character, we pop the top element from the stack (indicating we have found a pair and removed both).\n   - If the stack is empty or the top element is not the same as the current character, we push the current character onto the stack.\n4. **Result**: After processing all characters, the length of the stack is the minimized length of the string.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\n- **Example 1**: `s = \"aaabc\"`\n  - Stack: `['a', 'a', 'b', 'c']`\n  - Result: `4`\n\n- **Example 2**: `s = \"cbbd\"`\n  - Stack: `['c', 'b', 'd']`\n  - Result: `3`\n\n- **Example 3**: `s = \"dddaaa\"`\n  - Stack: `['d', 'a']`\n  - Result: `2`\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently minimize the string length by leveraging the stack data structure.\n\n### Constraints:\n\n- The length of the string `s` is between 1 and 100.\n- The string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.\n\nThis solution is efficient and works within the given constraints.", " To solve the problem of minimizing the length of a string by repeatedly deleting the closest occurrences of any character to the left and right of a chosen index, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Closest Occurrences**: For each character in the string, identify its closest occurrences to the left and right.\n2. **Delete the Closest Occurrences**: Remove these closest occurrences.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until no more deletions can be made.\n\nThe key observation here is that each deletion operation reduces the length of the string by 2 (one character is removed from each side of the chosen character). Therefore, the number of deletions is equal to the number of pairs of characters that can be removed.\n\nTo implement this, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters in the string as we iterate through it. Each time we encounter a character, we check if it can be paired with the last character in the stack.

The idea is to build numbers digit by digit and keep track of the current sum of digits.\n\n2. **Recursive Function**: We'll define a recursive function that will count the numbers with a given sum and length. This function will be used to explore all possible numbers within the given constraints.\n\n3. **Memoization**: To avoid recalculating results for the same states, we'll use memoization.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we'll take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def count(self, num1: str, num2: str, min_sum: int, max_sum: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        \n        # Helper function to count numbers with a given sum and length\n        def count_dp(pos, tight, sum_so_far):\n            if sum_so_far > max_sum:\n                return 0\n            if pos == len(num):\n                return 1 if min_sum <= sum_so_far <= max_sum else 0\n            if memo[pos][tight][sum_so_far] != -1:\n                return memo[pos][tight][sum_so_far]\n            \n            limit = int(num[pos]) if tight else 9\n            res = 0\n            for digit in range(0, limit + 1):\n                new_tight = tight and (digit == limit)\n                res += count_dp(pos + 1, new_tight, sum_so_far + digit)\n                res %= MOD\n            \n            memo[pos][tight][sum_so_far] = res\n            return res\n        \n        # Convert num2 to a list of digits\n        num = num2\n        memo = [[[-1 for _ in range(max_sum + 1)] for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(len(num) + 1)]\n        count_num2 = count_dp(0, 1, 0)\n        \n        # Reset memo for num1\n        memo = [[[-1 for _ in range(max_sum + 1)] for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(len(num) + 1)]\n        count_num1 = count_dp(0, 1, 0)\n        \n        # Subtract the count of numbers up to num1 from the count of numbers up to num2\n        result = (count_num2 - count_num1 + MOD) % MOD\n        \n        # Add numbers exactly with the sum of digits in [min_sum, max_sum]\n        for i in range(min_sum, max_sum + 1):\n            result = (result + count_dp(0, 1, i)) % MOD\n        \n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.count(\"1\", \"12\", 1, 8))  # Output: 11\nprint(sol.count(\"1\", \"5\", 1, 5))   # Output: 5\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **count_dp Function**: This function is used to count the numbers with a given sum and length. It uses memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid recalculating them.\n   - `pos`: Current position in the number.\n   - `tight`: Indicates if the current number is tightly bound to the given number.\n   - `sum_so_far`: Current sum of digits.\n\n2. **Memoization**: We use a 3D list `memo` to store the results of subproblems. `memo[pos][tight][sum_so_far]` stores the result for the current position, tight constraint, and sum of digits.\n\n3. **Recursive Exploration**: For each digit position, we explore all possible digits (0 to 9 if not tight, or up to the current digit if tight). We update the result and ensure it is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\n4. **Counting Numbers**: We first count the numbers up to `num2` and subtract the count of numbers up to `num1` to get the range count. We then add the count of numbers with exactly the sum of digits in the range `[min_sum, max_sum]`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the numbers without having to iterate through all possible integers, making it feasible for large constraints.", " To solve this problem, we need to count the number of integers within the range `[num1, num2]` whose digit sum lies between `min_sum` and `max_sum`. Given the constraints, a brute force approach that tries every integer in the range would be infeasible due to the large possible range of numbers. Instead, we can use dynamic programming to efficiently count the valid numbers.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Digit DP**: We'll use digit dynamic programming to count the numbers based on their digit sums.\n2. **Recursive with Memoization**: We'll define a recursive function that builds numbers digit by digit and uses memoization to store intermediate results.\n3. **Handling Bounds**: We'll handle the bounds of `num1` and `num2` separately by using a helper function to count numbers up to a given number.\n\nLet's implement this solution:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def count(self, num1: str, num2: str, min_sum: int, max_sum: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        \n        # Helper function to count numbers with digit sum in the range [0, upper_limit]\n        def count_valid_numbers(num, lower, upper):\n            memo = {}\n            \n            def dp(pos, tight, sum_so_far):\n                if sum_so_far > upper:\n                    return 0\n                if pos == len(num):\n                    return 1 if min_sum <= sum_so_far <= upper else 0\n                if (pos, tight, sum_so_far) in memo:\n                    return memo[(pos, tight, sum_so_far)]\n                \n                limit = int(num[pos]) if tight else 9\n                res = 0\n                for digit in range(0, limit + 1):\n                    new_tight = tight and (digit == limit)\n                    res += dp(pos + 1, new_tight, sum_so_far + digit)\n                    res %= MOD\n                \n                memo[(pos, tight, sum_so_far)] = res\n                return res\n            \n            return dp(0, 1, 0)\n        \n        # Count numbers from 0 to num2\n        count_num2 = count_valid_numbers(num2, max_sum, max_sum)\n        \n        # Count numbers from 0 to num1-1\n        count_num1_minus_1 = count_valid_numbers(num1, min_sum - 1, min_sum - 1)\n        \n        # The result is the difference between count_num2 and count_num1_minus_1\n        result = (count_num2 - count_num1_minus_1 + MOD) % MOD\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.count(\"1\", \"12\", 1, 8))  # Output: 11\nprint(sol.count(\"1\", \"5\", 1, 5))   # Output: 5\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **count_valid_numbers**: This function counts the numbers up to a given number (either `num2` or `num1-1`) whose digit sum lies between `min_sum` and `max_sum`.\n   - **dp**: This is a recursive function that builds numbers digit by digit.\n     - **pos**: The current position in the number string.\n     - **tight**: A boolean indicating if the current number being formed is tight (i.e., constrained by the prefix of the input number).\n     - **sum_so_far**: The sum of the digits of the current number being formed.\n   - **limit**: The maximum digit value we can place at the current position (based on whether we are tight or not).\n   - **res**: The result of the recursive function, which counts the valid numbers.\n\n2. **count_num2**: This counts the numbers from `0` to `num2` whose digit sum lies between `min_sum` and `max_sum`.\n\n3. **count_num1_minus_1**: This counts the numbers from `0` to `num1-1` whose digit sum lies between `min_sum-1` and `min_sum-1` (since we need to exclude numbers from `num1` to `num2`).\n\n4. **result**: The final count is the difference between `count_num2` and `count_num1_minus_1`, adjusted for modulo arithmetic.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the valid numbers without having to iterate through every possible number in the range.", " To solve this problem, we need to count the number of integers within the range `[num1, num2]` whose digit sum lies between `min_sum` and `max_sum`.

If it is, we update `max_strength`.\n\n3. **Recursive Calls**:\n   - We make two recursive calls:\n     - One where we include the current element (`nums[index]`) in the subset and multiply it with `current_product`.\n     - Another where we exclude the current element from the subset and keep `current_product` unchanged.\n\n4. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize `max_strength` to negative infinity to ensure any valid product will be larger.\n\n5. **Edge Case**:\n   - After the backtracking completes, we return the maximum of `max_strength` and `0`. This is because if all numbers are negative or zero, the maximum strength should be `0` (since the product of an empty set is considered `1`, and we need to handle the case where no positive product can be formed).\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible subsets and find the maximum strength efficiently within the given constraints."], "input_token_count": 418, "output_token_counts": [590, 634, 602, 582, 703], "total_token_counts": [1008, 1052, 1020, 1000, 1121], "pass_rate": 0.8, "results": [true, true, true, true, false], "thinking_time": [101.0, 107.0, 116.0, 26.0, 35.0], "average_thinking_time": 81.0}

This will help us determine the OR value if we perform the doubling operation at any specific index.\n\n2. **Iterate and Compute Maximum OR**: For each element in the array, calculate the OR value if we double that element and combine it with the OR values of the subarrays to its left and right.\n\n3. **Return the Maximum OR**: Track the maximum OR value obtained from the above steps.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumOr(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        \n        # Calculate prefix ORs\n        prefix_or = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix_or[i + 1] = prefix_or[i] | nums[i]\n        \n        # Calculate suffix ORs\n        suffix_or = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            suffix_or[i] = suffix_or[i + 1] | nums[i]\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum OR value\n        max_or = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Calculate OR if we double nums[i]\n            new_or = (nums[i] << k) | prefix_or[i] | suffix_or[i + 1]\n            max_or = max(max_or, new_or)\n        \n        return max_or\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.maximumOr([12, 9], 1))  # Output: 30\nprint(sol.maximumOr([8, 1, 2], 2))  # Output: 35\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Prefix OR Calculation**:\n   - `prefix_or[i]` stores the OR value of the subarray `nums[0:i]`.\n   - This is computed iteratively by OR-ing the current prefix with the current element.\n\n2. **Suffix OR Calculation**:\n   - `suffix_or[i]` stores the OR value of the subarray `nums[i:n]`.\n   - This is computed iteratively by OR-ing the current suffix with the current element, but in reverse order.\n\n3. **Iterate and Compute Maximum OR**:\n   - For each element `nums[i]`, we calculate the OR value if we double `nums[i]` and combine it with the OR values of the subarrays to its left and right using `prefix_or` and `suffix_or`.\n   - We keep track of the maximum OR value encountered during this process.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required OR values and find the maximum possible OR value after at most `k` operations.", " To solve the problem of finding the maximum possible value of `nums[0] | nums[1] | ... | nums[n - 1]` after applying the operation on `nums` at most `k` times, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation**: Each operation allows us to multiply an element by `2`. This means we can increase the value of any element by a factor of `2` in each operation.\n\n2. **Bitwise OR Operation**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number where each bit is set if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is set.\n\n3. **Objective**: Our goal is to maximize the bitwise OR of all elements in the array after performing at most `k` operations.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - For each element in the array, consider the impact of doubling it on the final OR result.\n   - We can use dynamic programming or bit manipulation to keep track of the possible values and their contributions to the final OR result.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - Iterate through each element in the array.\n   - For each element, calculate the OR value if we double it and see how it affects the overall OR result.\n   - Keep track of the maximum OR value obtained.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement this strategy:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumOr(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        prefix_or = [0] * (n + 1)\n        suffix_or = [0] * (n + 1)\n        \n        # Calculate prefix OR values\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix_or[i + 1] = prefix_or[i] | nums[i]\n        \n        # Calculate suffix OR values\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            suffix_or[i] = suffix_or[i + 1] | nums[i]\n        \n        max_or = 0\n        \n        # Try doubling each element and calculate the maximum OR value\n        for i in range(n):\n            current_or = prefix_or[i] | (nums[i] << k) | suffix_or[i + 1]\n            max_or = max(max_or, current_or)\n        \n        return max_or\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Prefix and Suffix OR Arrays**:\n   - `prefix_or[i]` represents the OR value of all elements from the start up to index `i-1`.\n   - `suffix_or[i]` represents the OR value of all elements from index `i+1` to the end.\n\n2. **Doubling Each Element**:\n   - For each element `nums[i]`, we consider the OR value if we double it (`nums[i] << k`).\n   - We combine this with the OR values from the prefix and suffix arrays to get the maximum OR value.\n\n3. **Iterate and Update**:\n   - We iterate through each element and update the maximum OR value accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of doubling elements and ensures we get the maximum OR value after at most `k` operations."], "input_token_count": 433, "output_token_counts": [723, 826, 742, 808, 751], "total_token_counts": [1156, 1259, 1175, 1241, 1184], "pass_rate": 0.8, "results": [true, true, false, true, true], "thinking_time": [263.0, 236.0, 143.0, 42.0, 89.0], "average_thinking_time": 156.0}

If it doesn't, we calculate the number of missing characters and add them to the result.\n- **Insertions**: Depending on the missing character(s), we increment the `result` counter accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we count the minimum number of characters needed to make the string valid.", " To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be added to the given string `word` to make it valid.

This means that every \"a\" must be followed by a \"b\" and then a \"c\", and this pattern must repeat throughout the string.\n\n2. **Identify Missing Characters**: For each segment of \"abc\" in the string, we need to check if all characters \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are present. If any of these characters are missing, we need to insert them.\n\n3. **Count Missing Characters**: We can iterate through the string and count the number of missing characters. Specifically, for each segment of \"abc\", we check:\n   - If there are no \"a\"s, we need to insert one.\n   - If there are no \"b\"s, we need to insert one.\n   - If there are no \"c\"s, we need to insert one.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the String**: We iterate through the string and use a pointer to keep track of the current position in the sequence \"abc\". If we reach the end of \"abc\", we reset the pointer and continue.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Insertions**: We keep a running total of the number of insertions needed to make the string valid.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above logic in Python:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def addMinimum(self, word: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize the count of insertions needed\n        insertions = 0\n        # Pointer to track the position in the sequence \"abc\"\n        i = 0\n        # Length of the sequence \"abc\"\n        seq_len = 3\n        \n        # Iterate through the word\n        while i < len(word):\n            # Check if the current character matches the expected character in \"abc\"\n            if i % seq_len == 0 and word[i] != 'a':\n                insertions += 1\n            elif i % seq_len == 1 and word[i] != 'b':\n                insertions += 1\n            elif i % seq_len == 2 and word[i] != 'c':\n                insertions += 1\n            i += 1\n        \n        return insertions\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.addMinimum(\"b\"))       # Output: 2\nprint(sol.addMinimum(\"aaa\"))     # Output: 6\nprint(sol.addMinimum(\"abc\"))     # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize `insertions` to 0 to keep track of the number of insertions needed.\n- **Pointer and Sequence Length**: We use `i` as a pointer to iterate through the string and `seq_len` to represent the length of the sequence \"abc\".\n- **Iteration**: We iterate through the string `word` and check if each character matches the expected character in \"abc\". If not, we increment the `insertions` counter.\n- **Return**: Finally, we return the total number of insertions needed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we count the minimum number of insertions required to make the string valid.", " To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be added to the given string `word` to make it a valid string.

For example, \"abcabcabc\" is valid, but \"ab\" or \"aabbcc\" are not valid.\n\n2. **Identify the Shortest Valid String**: The shortest valid string that can be formed by repeating \"abc\" is \"abc\" itself. Any deviation from this sequence requires additions.\n\n3. **Count the Deviations**: We need to count how many characters in `word` do not form part of the sequence \"abc\". Specifically, we need to check for the following deviations:\n   - Missing 'a' after 'b' or 'c'.\n   - Missing 'b' after 'a' or 'c'.\n   - Missing 'c' after 'a' or 'b'.\n\n4. **Calculate the Minimum Additions**: For each character in `word`, we check if it forms a valid sequence with the previous characters. If not, we need to add the missing character(s) to make it valid.\n\n5. **Implementation**: We iterate through the string and use a counter to keep track of the number of additions needed.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def addMinimum(self, word: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize the count of additions needed\n        additions = 0\n        # Expected next character in the sequence \"abc\"\n        expected_char = 'a'\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the word\n        for char in word:\n            # Check if the current character matches the expected character\n            if char == expected_char:\n                # Move to the next character in the sequence\n                expected_char = chr(ord(expected_char) + 1)\n                if expected_char > 'c':\n                    expected_char = 'a'\n            else:\n                # Increment the count of additions needed\n                additions += 1\n                # Check if the current character is 'b' or 'c' and adjust the expected character accordingly\n                if char == 'b':\n                    expected_char = 'c' if expected_char == 'a' else 'a'\n                elif char == 'c':\n                    expected_char = 'a' if expected_char == 'b' else 'b'\n        \n        # If the last character in the word is not the expected character, we need additional additions\n        if expected_char != 'a':\n            additions += 3 - (ord(expected_char) - ord('a'))\n        \n        return additions\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.addMinimum(\"b\"))  # Output: 2\n# print(sol.addMinimum(\"aaa\"))  # Output: 6\n# print(sol.addMinimum(\"abc\"))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the minimum number of additions needed to make the given string `word` valid by following the sequence \"abc\".", " To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of letters that must be inserted into the given string `word` to make it valid. A valid string is one that can be formed by concatenating the string \"abc\" several times.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to ensure that the given string `word` can be constructed by repeating \"abc\". This means that every \"a\" must be followed by \"b\" and then \"c\", and this pattern must repeat throughout the string.\n\n2. **Identify Missing Parts**: For each segment of \"abc\" in the string, we need to check if there are any missing characters. For example, if we have \"ab\" and then \"c\", we need to insert \"a\" before \"b\" and \"b\" before \"c\".\n\n3. **Count Missing Characters**: We can iterate through the string and count how many characters are missing to form the pattern \"abc\". If we find a sequence \"ab\" or \"bc\" without the third character, we need to insert the missing character.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Insertions**: Sum up all the missing characters required to make the string valid.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above logic in Python:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def addMinimum(self, word: str) -> int:\n        # The pattern \"abc\" has 3 characters\n        pattern_length = 3\n        \n        # Initialize the count of missing characters\n        missing_count = 0\n        \n        # Initialize the expected next character in the pattern\n        expected_char = 'a'\n        \n        # Iterate through the word\n        for char in word:\n            if char != expected_char:\n                # If the current character does not match the expected character,\n                # we need to insert the missing characters\n                missing_count += 1\n            else:\n                # Move to the next character in the pattern\n                expected_char = chr(ord(expected_char) + 1)\n                if expected_char > 'c':\n                    expected_char = 'a'\n        \n        # If the last segment was not completed, we need to insert the remaining characters\n        if expected_char != 'a':\n            missing_count += pattern_length - (ord(expected_char) - ord('a'))\n        \n        return missing_count\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.addMinimum(\"b\"))       # Output: 2\nprint(sol.addMinimum(\"aaa\"))     # Output: 6\nprint(sol.addMinimum(\"abc\"))     # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **pattern_length**: The length of the pattern \"abc\" is 3.\n- **missing_count**: This keeps track of the number of characters we need to insert.\n- **expected_char**: This keeps track of the next character we expect to see in the pattern.\n- **Iterate through the word**: For each character in the word, check if it matches the expected character. If not, increment the `missing_count`. If it matches, move to the next character in the pattern.\n- **Final Check**: After the loop, if the last segment was not completed, calculate the number of missing characters to complete the last segment.\n\nThis approach ensures that we count the minimum number of characters needed to be inserted to make the string valid.", " To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of letters that must be inserted to make a given string `word` valid, we need to understand what constitutes a valid string.

Each missing \"abc\" sequence requires the insertion of at least one \"a\", one \"b\", and one \"c\".\n\n3. **Iterate Through the String**: As we iterate through the string, we check if the current character completes a \"abc\" sequence.

Otherwise, we move the lower bound to `mid + 1`.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimizeMax(self, nums: List[int], p: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        \n        def canFormPairs(max_diff: int) -> bool:\n            count = 0\n            i = 0\n            while i < len(nums) - 1:\n                if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] <= max_diff:\n                    count += 1\n                    i += 2\n                else:\n                    i += 1\n                if count >= p:\n                    return True\n            return False\n        \n        left, right = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if canFormPairs(mid):\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        return left\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minimizeMax([10, 1, 2, 7, 1, 3], 2))  # Output: 1\nprint(sol.minimizeMax([4, 2, 1, 2], 1))         # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sorting**: We start by sorting the array `nums` to make it easier to find pairs with the smallest differences.\n2. **Binary Search**: We use binary search to find the minimum possible maximum difference.\n3. **Greedy Check**: The `canFormPairs` function checks if we can form `p` pairs with a given maximum difference. It iterates through the sorted array and counts pairs whose difference is within the given limit.\n4. **Adjusting Search Range**: Based on whether we can form `p` pairs, we adjust the search range for the binary search.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum possible maximum difference by leveraging binary search and greedy counting of pairs.", " To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach along with a greedy strategy to check if we can form `p` pairs with a maximum difference less than or equal to a given value. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Binary Search for the Answer**: We will use binary search to find the minimum possible maximum difference among all `p` pairs. The search range for the binary search will be from `0` to `max(nums) - min(nums)`, since the maximum difference can't be more than the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\n2. **Greedy Check**: For each midpoint in the binary search, we will use a greedy approach to check if we can form `p` pairs such that the maximum difference is less than or equal to the midpoint. To do this, we will sort the array and then iterate through it, pairing adjacent elements whenever the difference between them is less than or equal to the midpoint.\n\n3. **Count Valid Pairs**: During the greedy check, we will count how many pairs can be formed with a difference less than or equal to the current midpoint. If the count is greater than or equal to `p`, it means we can achieve the desired maximum difference with `p` pairs.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimizeMax(self, nums: List[int], p: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        \n        def canFormPairs(mid: int) -> bool:\n            count = 0\n            i = 0\n            while i < len(nums) - 1:\n                if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] <= mid:\n                    count += 1\n                    i += 2\n                else:\n                    i += 1\n                if count >= p:\n                    return True\n            return False\n        \n        left, right = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if canFormPairs(mid):\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        return left\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minimizeMax([10, 1, 2, 7, 1, 3], 2))  # Output: 1\nprint(sol.minimizeMax([4, 2, 1, 2], 1))         # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting**: We start by sorting the array `nums`. This helps in easily finding pairs with the smallest differences.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: We initialize the binary search with `left` set to `0` and `right` set to `max(nums) - min(nums)`.\n\n3. **Greedy Check Function (`canFormPairs`)**: This function checks if we can form `p` pairs with a maximum difference of `mid`. It iterates through the sorted array and counts pairs whose difference is less than or equal to `mid`.\n\n4. **Binary Search Loop**: We perform the binary search by checking the midpoint of the current range. If we can form `p` pairs with a maximum difference of `mid`, we move the `right` boundary to `mid`. Otherwise, we move the `left` boundary to `mid + 1`.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: The loop continues until `left` equals `right`, at which point `left` (or `right`) will be the minimum possible maximum difference among all `p` pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum maximum difference by leveraging binary search and greedy techniques.", " To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach along with a greedy strategy to check if we can form `p` pairs with a maximum difference less than or equal to a given value. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Binary Search for the Answer**: We will use binary search to find the minimum possible maximum difference. The search space for the binary search will be from `0` to `max(nums) - min(nums)`, since the maximum difference can't be more than the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\n2. **Greedy Check**: For a given potential maximum difference, we will use a greedy approach to check if we can form `p` pairs with differences less than or equal to this value. We will sort the array first and then iterate through it, checking pairs and counting how many pairs can have a difference less than or equal to the given value.\n\n3. **Implementation**: We will implement the above logic in the `minimizeMax` function.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimizeMax(self, nums: List[int], p: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        n = len(nums)\n        \n        def canFormPairs(max_diff: int) -> bool:\n            count = 0\n            i = 0\n            while i < n - 1:\n                if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] <= max_diff:\n                    count += 1\n                    i += 2\n                else:\n                    i += 1\n                if count >= p:\n                    return True\n            return False\n        \n        left, right = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]\n        while left < right:\n            mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n            if canFormPairs(mid):\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        return left\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minimizeMax([10,1,2,7,1,3], 2))  # Output: 1\nprint(sol.minimizeMax([4,2,1,2], 1))       # Output: 0\n```\n\nThis code defines a `Solution` class with a `minimizeMax` method that takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `p`, and returns the minimum possible maximum difference among all `p` pairs.

Initially, 1is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is 0. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1.

We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray [0, 2] for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create an array `ans` of length `n` initialized to `-1` to store the minimum number of operations for each position.\n   - Set `ans[p]` to `0` because the `1` is already at position `p`.\n\n2. **Banned Positions**:\n   - Mark the banned positions in the `ans` array as `-1` since the `1` cannot be moved to these positions.\n\n3. **Possible Reverse Operations**:\n   - For each position `i`, determine the possible subarrays of size `k` that can be reversed to potentially move the `1` to position `i`.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n   - Use BFS to explore the minimum number of operations required to move the `1` from its current position to any other position.\n   - Initialize a queue with the starting position `p` and set `ans[p]` to `0`.\n   - For each position, explore all possible subarrays of size `k` that can be reversed to move the `1` to the current position.\n   - Update the `ans` array for each reachable position.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - Ensure that the subarrays do not include any banned positions.\n   - Continue the BFS until all positions are processed or the queue is empty.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minReverseOperations(self, n: int, p: int, banned: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n        ans = [-1] * n\n        banned_set = set(banned)\n        if p not in banned_set:\n            ans[p] = 0\n        queue = deque([p])\n        \n        while queue:\n            x = queue.popleft()\n            left = max(x - k + 1, 0)\n            right = min(x, n - k)\n            \n            for y in range(left, right + 1):\n                if y not in banned_set and ans[y] == -1:\n                    ans[y] = ans[x] + 1\n                    queue.append(y)\n        \n        return ans\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `ans` is initialized to `-1` for all positions.\n   - `banned_set` is created to quickly check if a position is banned.\n   - `ans[p]` is set to `0` because the `1` is already at position `p`.\n   - `queue` is initialized with the starting position `p`.\n\n2. **BFS Loop**:\n   - Dequeue a position `x`.\n   - Calculate the left and right bounds for the subarray that can be reversed to potentially move the `1` to position `y`.\n   - For each valid position `y` (not banned and not yet processed), update `ans[y]` and enqueue `y`.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - After the BFS completes, return the `ans` array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of operations required to bring the `1` to each position or determine that it's impossible.", " To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of reverse operations required to bring the `1` to each position `i` in the array `arr`, or `-1` if it's impossible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialize the Array**: Create an array `arr` of length `n` with all elements set to `0`, except for position `p` which is set to `1`.\n\n2. **Mark Banned Positions**: Mark the positions in the `banned` array as `0` in `arr`.\n\n3. **Determine the Feasibility**: If `k` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to move the `1` to any position because the subarray size exceeds the array length.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to explore the minimum number of reverse operations required to move the `1` to each position `i`. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring the minimum number of operations.\n\n5. **Queue for BFS**: Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the number of operations required to reach that position.\n\n6. **Visited Array**: Maintain a visited array to avoid revisiting positions that have already been processed.\n\n7. **Reverse Operations**: For each position, consider all possible subarrays of size `k` that can be reversed to potentially move the `1` to the desired position.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minReverseOperations(self, n: int, p: int, banned: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n        if k > n:\n            return [-1] * n\n        \n        # Initialize the array with 0s and set the position p to 1\n        arr = [0] * n\n        arr[p] = 1\n        \n        # Mark banned positions as 0\n        for ban in banned:\n            arr[ban] = 0\n        \n        # BFS initialization\n        queue = deque([(p, 0)])  # (position, number of operations)\n        visited = [False] * n\n        visited[p] = True\n        \n        ans = [-1] * n\n        ans[p] = 0\n        \n        while queue:\n            pos, ops = queue.popleft()\n            \n            # Check all possible subarrays of size k\n            for start in range(max(0, pos - k + 1), min(n - k + 1, pos) + 1):\n                end = start + k - 1\n                if arr[start] == 1 and not visited[end]:\n                    visited[end] = True\n                    ans[end] = ops + 1\n                    queue.append((end, ops + 1))\n        \n        return ans\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize the array `arr` with `0`s and set the position `p` to `1`. We also mark the banned positions as `0`.\n\n2. **BFS Setup**: We use a queue to perform BFS. Each element in the queue is a tuple containing the current position and the number of operations required to reach that position.\n\n3. **Visited Array**: We maintain a `visited` array to keep track of positions that have already been processed.\n\n4. **Reverse Operations**: For each position, we consider all possible subarrays of size `k` that can be reversed.

Given the circular nature of the array, we can consider any subarray of length `k` to be a contiguous segment of the array.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to make the sum of each subarray of length `k` equal. This means for each starting index `i` (from `0` to `k-1`), the sum of `arr[i], arr[i+k], arr[i+2k], ...` should be the same.\n\n2. **Brute Force Approach**: One way to approach this problem is to try to make the sum of each subarray equal by incrementing or decrementing elements. However, this can be inefficient for large arrays.\n\n3. **Efficient Approach**: Instead of trying to adjust each element individually, we can focus on making the elements in each cycle equal. Since the array is circular, each element can be part of multiple subarrays.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection**: We can detect cycles of length `k` in the array. For each cycle, we need to make all elements equal. The minimum number of operations required to make all elements in a cycle equal is the median of the cycle.\n\n5. **Calculate Operations**: For each cycle, calculate the number of operations needed to make all elements equal to the median.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def makeSubKSumEqual(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(arr)\n        visited = [False] * n\n        operations = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            if not visited[i]:\n                cycle = []\n                j = i\n                while not visited[j]:\n                    visited[j] = True\n                    cycle.append(arr[j])\n                    j = (j + k) % n\n                median = sorted(cycle)[len(cycle) // 2]\n                for num in cycle:\n                    operations += abs(num - median)\n        \n        return operations\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a list `visited` to keep track of which elements have been processed and a variable `operations` to count the total number of operations.\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: We iterate over each element in the array. If the element has not been visited, we start a new cycle from that element.\n\n3. **Cycle Collection**: We collect all elements in the current cycle into a list `cycle`. We mark each element as visited and move to the next element in the cycle.\n\n4. **Median Calculation**: For each cycle, we calculate the median and then compute the number of operations needed to make all elements in the cycle equal to the median.\n\n5. **Sum of Operations**: We sum up the operations for all cycles to get the total number of operations required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of each subarray of length `k` equal.", " To solve the problem of making all subarrays of length `k` have equal sums, we need to ensure that each subarray has the same sum. Given the circular nature of the array, we can consider any subarray of length `k` starting from any index.\n\nThe key idea is to find the target sum for each subarray and then determine the minimum number of operations required to make all subarrays of length `k` equal to this target sum.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Determine the Target Sum for Each Subarray**: Since the array is circular, we can consider any starting index for the subarray. The target sum for each subarray can be calculated as the average of the elements in the subarray. However, due to the constraints of the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of each subarray is equal to the target sum.\n\n2. **Calculate the Minimum Operations**: For each subarray, calculate the difference between the current sum and the target sum. The total number of operations required will be the sum of the absolute differences.\n\n3. **Implementation**: We can use a sliding window approach to iterate through the array and calculate the sum of each subarray. However, given the constraints, this approach might not be efficient. Instead, we can use a more mathematical approach to directly compute the required operations.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def makeSubKSumEqual(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(arr)\n        operations = 0\n        \n        for i in range(k):\n            subarray = []\n            for j in range(i, n, k):\n                subarray.append(arr[j])\n            subarray.sort()\n            median = subarray[len(subarray) // 2]\n            for num in subarray:\n                operations += abs(num - median)\n        \n        return operations\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize `operations` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of operations required.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Each Starting Index**: We iterate over each possible starting index `i` for the subarray.\n\n3. **Collect Subarray Elements**: For each starting index `i`, we collect all elements that belong to the subarray by iterating with a step size of `k`.\n\n4. **Sort the Subarray**: We sort the collected subarray to easily find the median.\n\n5. **Calculate Median**: The median is the middle element of the sorted subarray.\n\n6. **Compute Operations**: For each element in the subarray, we compute the absolute difference between the element and the median and add it to the `operations` count.\n\n7. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the total number of operations required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum number of operations required to make all subarrays of length `k` have equal sums.", " To solve the problem of making all subarrays of length `k` have equal sums, we need to ensure that the sum of elements in each subarray is the same.

This can be done by iterating from `0` to `value-1` and checking the frequency of each possible value.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findSmallestInteger(self, nums: List[int], value: int) -> int:\n        # Step 1: Map each element to its modulo with respect to value\n        modulo_counts = Counter(num % value for num in nums)\n        \n        # Step 2: Find the smallest missing non-negative integer\n        mex = 0\n        while True:\n            if modulo_counts[mex % value] > 0:\n                modulo_counts[mex % value] -= 1\n            else:\n                break\n            mex += 1\n        \n        return mex\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.findSmallestInteger([1, -10, 7, 13, 6, 8], 5))  # Output: 4\n# print(sol.findSmallestInteger([1, -10, 7, 13, 6, 8], 7))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Modulo Mapping**: We use a list comprehension to compute the modulo of each element in `nums` with respect to `value`. This helps in reducing the range of values we need to consider.\n\n2. **Frequency Counting**: We use a `Counter` to count the frequency of each modulo result. This gives us a direct way to check how many times each possible value can be formed.\n\n3. **Finding MEX**: We iterate from `0` to `value-1` and check if the current value can be formed. If it can, we decrement the count and move to the next value. If it cannot, we have found the smallest missing non-negative integer.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum MEX after all possible operations."], "input_token_count": 635, "output_token_counts": [587, 631, 614, 685, 659], "total_token_counts": [1222, 1266, 1249, 1320, 1294], "pass_rate": 1.0, "results": [true, true, true, true, true], "thinking_time": [126.0, 135.0, 74.0, 137.0, 75.0], "average_thinking_time": 112.0}

If it is, we increment the count and move the pointer `j` to the next element.\n4. **Return**: The final value of `count` is the maximum possible greatness.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are maximizing the number of elements in the permuted array that are greater than the corresponding elements in the original array.", " To solve the problem of maximizing the greatness of an array, we need to find the maximum number of indices `i` such that `perm[i] > nums[i]` after permuting the array `nums`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the array `nums`.

This is possible if and only if the number of `1`s in the binary representation of each element in the subarray is even. This is because each operation flips a bit, and we need an even number of `1`s to eventually flip all of them to `0`.\n3. **Prefix XOR**: We can use the concept of prefix XOR to determine the number of `1`s in the subarray ending at each index. If the XOR of a subarray is `0`, then the number of `1`s in that subarray is even, making it a beautiful subarray.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Calculate Prefix XOR**: Compute the prefix XOR of the array `nums`.

If it has appeared an even number of times, it means there are an even number of `1`s in the subarray ending at the current index, making it a beautiful subarray.\n3. **Calculate Combinations**: For each prefix XOR that appears an even number of times, the number of beautiful subarrays ending at the current index is the number of times it has appeared minus one (since we are interested in pairs).\n\n### Implementation:\nHere's the Python code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def beautifulSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        prefix_xor = 0\n        xor_count = defaultdict(int)\n        xor_count[0] = 1  # There's one way to have an empty subarray with XOR 0\n        beautiful_subarrays = 0\n        \n        for num in nums:\n            prefix_xor ^= num\n            beautiful_subarrays += xor_count[prefix_xor]\n            xor_count[prefix_xor] += 1\n        \n        return beautiful_subarrays\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.beautifulSubarrays([4, 3, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 2\nprint(sol.beautifulSubarrays([1, 10, 4]))       # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We start with `prefix_xor` as `0` and initialize a hashmap `xor_count` with `{0: 1}` because there's one way to have an empty subarray with XOR `0`.\n- **Iterate through `nums`**: For each number in `nums`, update the `prefix_xor`.\n- **Count Beautiful Subarrays**: For each `prefix_xor`, add the count of how many times it has appeared before to `beautiful_subarrays`.\n- **Update Hashmap**: Increment the count of the current `prefix_xor` in the hashmap.\n- **Return Result**: Finally, return the total count of beautiful subarrays.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of beautiful subarrays in `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the length of the array.", " To solve the problem of counting the number of beautiful subarrays, we need to understand the properties of the binary representation of numbers and how we can manipulate them to make all elements in a subarray equal to zero.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Bit Manipulation**:\n   - Each number in the array can be represented in binary form.\n   - We can perform the operation of subtracting `2^k` from two numbers if their `kth` bit is `1`.\n   - To make all elements in a subarray equal to zero, the XOR of all elements in the subarray must be zero.

This gives the number of subarrays that can be formed ending at the current index with an XOR of zero.\n   - Increment the count of the current `prefix_xor` in the dictionary.\n\n3. **Return the result**:\n   - The total count of beautiful subarrays is returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all possible beautiful subarrays in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the array.", " To solve the problem of counting the number of beautiful subarrays, we need to understand the properties of the binary representation of numbers and how we can manipulate them to make all elements in a subarray equal to zero.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Bit Manipulation**: Each number in the array can be represented in binary form. We need to check if there are pairs of numbers in the subarray such that the `kth` bit is set in both numbers.\n2. **Subarray Beauty**: A subarray is beautiful if we can make all its elements zero by performing the given operation any number of times. This means the XOR of all elements in the subarray must be zero.\n3. **Prefix XOR**: The XOR of all elements up to a certain index can help us determine if a subarray is beautiful. If the XOR of elements from the start to index `i` is equal to the XOR of elements from the start to index `j` (where `i < j`), then the subarray from `i+1` to `j` can be made zero.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Compute Prefix XOR**: Calculate the prefix XOR array where `prefix[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start to index `i`.\n2. **Count Subarrays**: Use a dictionary to count how many times each XOR value occurs. For each prefix XOR value, check how many times it has occurred before (i.e., how many subarrays ending at the current index have an XOR of zero).\n\n### Implementation:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def beautifulSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        prefix_xor = 0\n        count = defaultdict(int)\n        count[0] = 1  # There's one way to have an empty subarray with XOR 0\n        beautiful_subarrays = 0\n        \n        for num in nums:\n            prefix_xor ^= num\n            beautiful_subarrays += count[prefix_xor]\n            count[prefix_xor] += 1\n        \n        return beautiful_subarrays\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `prefix_xor` as 0 and initialize a dictionary `count` to keep track of the frequency of each XOR value.\n2. **Iterate through the array**: For each number in the array, update the `prefix_xor` by XORing it with the current number.\n3. **Count Beautiful Subarrays**: For each prefix XOR value, add the number of times it has occurred before to the count of beautiful subarrays. This is because having the same XOR value before means the subarray between those indices has an XOR of zero.\n4. **Update the Dictionary**: Increment the count of the current prefix XOR value in the dictionary.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all possible beautiful subarrays by leveraging the properties of XOR and prefix sums."], "input_token_count": 749, "output_token_counts": [751, 769, 865, 793, 648], "total_token_counts": [1500, 1518, 1614, 1542, 1397], "pass_rate": 1.0, "results": [true, true, true, true, true], "thinking_time": [109.0, 90.0, 60.0, 48.0, 31.0], "average_thinking_time": 66.0}

This helps in efficiently determining divisibility.\n\n4. **Update the Result Array**: Based on the result of the divisibility check, update the corresponding position in the result array.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach in Python:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def divisibilityArray(self, word: str, m: int) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(word)\n        result = [0] * n\n        current_value = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            current_value = current_value * 10 + int(word[i])\n            current_value %= m\n            if current_value == 0:\n                result[i] = 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `n` is the length of the string `word`.\n   - `result` is an array of zeros with the same length as `word`.\n   - `current_value` is initialized to `0`, which will keep track of the numeric value of the current prefix.\n\n2. **Iteration**:\n   - For each character in `word`, convert it to an integer and update `current_value` by multiplying it by `10` (to shift the digits) and adding the current character's integer value.\n   - Use modulo `m` to keep `current_value` manageable and within the range of typical integer values.\n\n3. **Divisibility Check**:\n   - After updating `current_value`, check if it is divisible by `m`. If it is, set `result[i]` to `1`.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - After processing all characters, return the `result` array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the divisibility of each prefix without running into issues with large numeric values.

If it is, we double `x` (i.e., `x *= 2`) and check again.\n3. **Return the Smallest Missing Number**: The loop continues until we find the smallest number that is not in `num_set`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the smallest missing positive integer that cannot be expressed as the bitwise OR of any subsequence of `nums`.", " To solve the problem of finding the minimum positive non-zero integer that is not expressible from a given array `nums`, we need to understand the concept of bitwise OR and how it works.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Bitwise OR Operation**: The bitwise OR of any set of numbers is the number formed by OR-ing all the bits of all numbers in the set.\n2. **Expressibility**: An integer `x` is expressible if there exists a subsequence of `nums` such that the bitwise OR of the subsequence equals `x`.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Identify the Smallest Missing Power of 2**: The smallest positive non-zero integer that is not expressible will be a power of 2. This is because any number that can be formed by OR-ing elements of `nums` will be a result of combining existing numbers, and the smallest gap between powers of 2 will be the missing number.\n2. **Check Powers of 2**: We need to check the smallest powers of 2 starting from 1 (which is `2^0`) and see if they can be formed by OR-ing elements of `nums`.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Sort and Remove Duplicates**: Sort the array and remove duplicates to simplify the checking process.\n2. **Check Powers of 2**: Start from 1 and check if it can be formed by OR-ing elements of `nums`. If not, it means this power of 2 is the smallest missing number.\n\n### Implementation:\nHere's the Python code to implement the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minImpossibleOR(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        nums_set = set(nums)\n        i = 1\n        while True:\n            if i not in nums_set:\n                return i\n            i *= 2\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minImpossibleOR([2, 1]))  # Output: 4\nprint(sol.minImpossibleOR([5, 3, 2]))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Set Conversion**: Convert `nums` to a set `nums_set` to remove duplicates and allow O(1) lookups.\n2. **Loop Through Powers of 2**: Start with `i = 1` (which is `2^0`) and check if it is in `nums_set`. If not, return `i`. If it is, multiply `i` by 2 and check again.\n3. **Return the Smallest Missing Power of 2**: The first power of 2 that is not in `nums_set` is the smallest missing number.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the smallest missing power of 2 that cannot be formed by OR-ing elements of `nums`.", " To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive non-zero integer that cannot be expressed as the bitwise OR of any subsequence of the given array `nums`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Range of Possible Results**: \n   - The maximum possible result of the bitwise OR of any subsequence of `nums` is the bitwise OR of all elements in `nums`. This is because the OR operation will only increase the number of set bits.\n   - Therefore, the smallest positive non-zero integer that is not expressible must be less than or equal to the bitwise OR of all elements in `nums`.\n\n2. **Check for Missing Numbers**:\n   - We need to check which numbers from 1 up to the bitwise OR of all elements in `nums` are not expressible.\n   - We can use a set to store all the numbers that can be expressed from `nums`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Check**:\n   - Start from 1 and check if it can be expressed as the bitwise OR of some subsequence of `nums`.\n   - If it can be expressed, move to the next number.\n   - If it cannot be expressed, return that number as the result.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minImpossibleOR(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Create a set from the nums array for O(1) lookups\n        num_set = set(nums)\n        \n        # Start checking from 1 upwards\n        x = 1\n        while True:\n            if x not in num_set:\n                return x\n            x *= 2\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.minImpossibleOR([2, 1]))  # Output: 4\nprint(sol.minImpossibleOR([5, 3, 2]))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Set Creation**: We convert the list `nums` to a set `num_set` to allow O(1) lookups.\n- **Checking for Missing Numbers**: We start with `x = 1` and check if `x` is in `num_set`. If not, we return `x`. If `x` is in `num_set`, we double `x` (i.e., `x *= 2`) and check again.\n- **Doubling `x`**: Since we are looking for the smallest number that cannot be expressed, we use powers of 2 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, ...) and check if each power of 2 is in `num_set`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the smallest positive non-zero integer that is not expressible from `nums`."], "input_token_count": 409, "output_token_counts": [799, 532, 605, 647, 647], "total_token_counts": [1208, 941, 1014, 1056, 1056], "pass_rate": 1.0, "results": [true, true, true, true, true], "thinking_time": [128.0, 187.0, 75.0, 27.0, 54.0], "average_thinking_time": 85.66666666666667}

Pointer `i` starts from the beginning, and pointer `j` starts from the end.\n3. **Count Pairs**: For each position of `i`, use `j` to find the range of valid pairs. The sum of the elements at positions `i` and `j` should be between `lower` and `upper`.\n4. **Adjust Pointers**: Move the pointers accordingly to explore all possible pairs.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def countFairPairs(self, nums: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        n = len(nums)\n        count = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            # Find the right boundary for the second pointer\n            left = bisect_left(nums, lower - nums[i])\n            right = bisect_right(nums, upper - nums[i])\n            \n            # Adjust for the current index i\n            if left <= i < right:\n                right -= 1\n            \n            # Count the pairs\n            count += max(0, right - left)\n        \n        return count\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Sorting**: `nums.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order.\n2. **Initialization**: `n` is the length of the array, and `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of fair pairs.\n3. **Iterate through the Array**: The outer loop runs through each index `i` of the array.\n4. **Find Boundaries**:\n   - `left` is found using `bisect_left(nums, lower - nums[i])`, which gives the leftmost index where the value `lower - nums[i]` could be inserted to maintain order.\n   - `right` is found using `bisect_right(nums, upper - nums[i])`, which gives the rightmost index where the value `upper - nums[i]` could be inserted to maintain order.\n5. **Adjust for Current Index**: If `left` is less than or equal to `i` and `i` is less than `right`, adjust `right` to exclude the current index `i` to avoid counting the pair `(i, i)`.\n6. **Count Valid Pairs**: Add the number of valid pairs between `left` and `right` (exclusive of `right`) to `count`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of fair pairs using sorting and binary search, which are both efficient operations with time complexities of \\(O(n \\log n)\\) and \\(O(\\log n)\\), respectively.", " To solve the problem of counting the number of fair pairs in a given array `nums` with a specified range `[lower, upper]`, we can use a two-pointer technique.

The key observation is that for any number `x` on the board, the numbers `1 <= i <= n` such that `x % i == 1` will be added to the board. This means that every number `x` on the board will add at least one new number to the board the next day, except for the number `1`, which does not add any new numbers because `x % 1 == 0` for all `x`.\n\nGiven this, we can deduce that the number of distinct integers on the board will stabilize after a certain number of days. Specifically, the board will eventually contain all numbers from `1` to `n` because each number `x` will eventually add all numbers `i` such that `1 <= i <= n` to the board.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct integers on the board after `10^9` days will be `n` itself, because by that time, all numbers from `1` to `n` will have been added to the board.\n\nHere's the implementation of this logic:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def distinctIntegers(self, n: int) -> int:\n        return n\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.distinctIntegers(5))  # Output: 4\nprint(sol.distinctIntegers(3))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis solution is efficient and works within the constraints provided.", " To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of how numbers are added to the board each day.

However, the problem states that this process will continue for `10^9` days, which is a very large number. \n\nTo simplify, we can observe that once a number `x` is added to the board, it will remain there because the condition `x % i == 1` will always be true for some `i` in the range `1 <= i <= n`.

Additionally, for any number `x`, `x - 1` will also be a valid number to add to the board because `(x - 1) % x == 1`.\n\nGiven this, we can see that every number `x` on the board will generate at least two new numbers (`1` and `x - 1`) that will also be added to the board.

For each combination, we check if the conditions are satisfied.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - Use four nested loops to iterate through all possible values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`.\n   - For each combination, check if `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]`.\n   - Count all such valid quadruplets.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countQuadruplets(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        count = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                    for l in range(k + 1, n):\n                        if nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]:\n                            count += 1\n        \n        return count\n\n# Example usage:\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.countQuadruplets([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]))  # Output: 2\nprint(sol.countQuadruplets([1, 2, 3, 4]))     # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Outer Loops**: We use four nested loops to iterate through all possible values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`.\n- **Condition Check**: For each combination of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`, we check if `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]`.\n- **Count Increment**: If the condition is satisfied, we increment the count.\n\n### Complexity:\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n^4) in the worst case, as we have four nested loops.\n- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.\n\nThis approach is straightforward and ensures that we check all possible quadruplets. Given the constraints, this should work within the limits.", " To solve the problem of counting increasing quadruplets in a given array `nums`, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find all quadruplets `(i, j, k, l)` such that:\n   - `0 <= i < j < k < l < n`\n   - `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]`\n\n2. **Brute Force Approach**: A straightforward approach would be to iterate through all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l` and check if the conditions are met. This approach is feasible but may not be efficient for large arrays.\n\n3. **Efficient Approach**: We can use a nested loop structure to efficiently count the quadruplets. Here's the outline of the approach:\n   - Use three nested loops to fix `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n   - For each fixed `i`, `j`, and `k`, check how many values of `l` (where `l > k`) satisfy the condition `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]`.\n\n4. **Implementation**: We will implement this approach in Python.\n\nHere is the Python code to count the increasing quadruplets:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def countQuadruplets(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        count = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                    for l in range(k + 1, n):\n                        if nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]:\n                            count += 1\n        \n        return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Outer Loop**: `for i in range(n)` iterates over all possible values of `i`.\n- **Middle Loop**: `for j in range(i + 1, n)` iterates over all possible values of `j` such that `j > i`.\n- **Inner Loop**: `for k in range(j + 1, n)` iterates over all possible values of `k` such that `k > j`.\n- **Innermost Loop**: `for l in range(k + 1, n)` iterates over all possible values of `l` such that `l > k`.\n- **Condition Check**: `if nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]` checks if the quadruplet satisfies the increasing condition.\n- **Count Update**: `count += 1` increments the count if the condition is met.\n\nThis approach ensures that we check all possible quadruplets and count those that satisfy the increasing condition.
