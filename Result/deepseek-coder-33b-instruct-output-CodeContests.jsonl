Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments.

Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j.

First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2.

To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station.\n\nDue to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th event will add additional amount of x_i to the cost of building a new railway from the station k_i.\n\nTo save resources, before all incidents and after each incident, Nitori wants you to help her calculate the minimal cost of railway construction.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 q \u2264 2\u22c510^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers w_1,w_2,\u2026,w_n (1 \u2264 w_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, d (1 \u2264 u,v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^9), denoting a two-way railway connecting station u and station v, with length d.\n\nThe i-th of the next q lines contains two integers k_i,x_i (1 \u2264 k_i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 x_i \u2264 4 \u00d7 10^8).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q+1 lines, and the i-th of these lines contains one integer, denoting the minimal cost of railway construction after the i-1-th incident (especially, the 0-th incident means no incident occurred).\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 4 1\n3 5 1\n4 5 1\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n9\n\n\nInput\n\n\n8 11 0\n14 4 16 15 1 3 1 14\n4 2 1\n1 2 3\n7 5 4\n2 3 1\n8 6 2\n8 5 5\n5 4 5\n7 6 7\n3 5 5\n1 6 6\n8 1 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n46\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10 16 8\n29 1 75 73 51 69 24 17 1 97\n1 2 18\n2 3 254\n2 4 546\n2 5 789\n5 6 998\n6 7 233\n7 8 433\n1 9 248\n5 10 488\n2 6 1787\n10 8 1176\n3 8 2199\n4 8 1907\n2 10 1277\n4 10 731\n9 10 1047\n1 11\n1 9\n8 8\n1 3\n2 19\n9 5\n9 4\n7 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n34\n45\n54\n54\n57\n76\n96\n112\n112\n\nNote\n\nIn the second example, Nitori can build railways as follows: 1 \u2192 2, 1 \u2192 3, 1 \u2192 4, 2 \u2192 8, and the cost is 14 + 14 + 14 + 4 = 46.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries.\n\nA query consists of an array a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n of integers between 1 and n. a is not required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of a and p, meaning that he will compute an array s where s_j = p_j + a_j for all j = 1, 2, \u2026, n. Then, he will find the smallest index k such that s_k occurs more than once in s, and answer with k. If there is no such index k, then he will answer with 0.\n\nYou can perform at most 2n queries. Figure out the meaning of life p.\n\nInteraction\n\nStart the interaction by reading single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the permutation p.\n\nYou can then make queries.

Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n  * System.out.flush() in Java;\n  * flush(output) in Pascal;\n  * stdout.flush() in Python;\n  * see documentation for other languages.\n\n\n\nTo output your answer, print a single line \"! \\enspace p_1 \\enspace p_2 \\enspace \u2026 \\enspace p_n\" then terminate.\n\nYou can make at most 2n queries.

Nothing happens until time 3, when Okabe realizes that he should have done the 2-nd task at time 2. He then time travels to time 2 and completes the task.\n\nAs the task is done now, he does not time travel again when the time is again 3. However, at time 4, he travels to time 1 to complete the 1-st task.\n\nThis undoes the 2-nd task. This means that the 2-nd task is not currently completed, meaning that the funny scene will not occur at this point even though the 1-st task is currently completed and Okabe had previously completed the 2-nd task.\n\nOnce it is again time 3 he travels back to time 2 once more and does the 2-nd task again.\n\nNow all tasks are complete, with Okabe having time travelled 3 times.\n\nThe second sample has the same tasks for Okabe to complete. However, this time the funny scene only needs the first task to be completed in order to occur.

{"id": "code_contests/43", "prompt": "# Omkar and Tours\n\nOmkar is hosting tours of his country, Omkarland! There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines.

For the edges, unbolded numbers represent capacities and bolded numbers represent tolls.\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 3 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4.

They take turns in order one after another. After each turn, they move one card in their current direction. If they reach the end or beginning of the line of cards they change direction. Once they meet in a card, the card is marked for removal and is removed the first moment they both leave the card.\n\n<image> Example of how card is removed\n\nThey repeat this process until there is only one restaurant card left. Since there are a lot of restaurant cards, they are bored to simulate this process over and over and need your help to determine the last card that remains. Can you help them? \n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input is one integer T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^{4}) representing number of test cases. Each test case contains 3 lines: The first line contains an integer N representing initial number of cards. Next line contains two integer values A,B (0 \u2264 A, B < N, 2 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{18}) representing starting 0-based index of the card in the array. Last line contains two strings D_A, D_B \u2208 {\"left\", \"right\"} representing starting direction of their movement.\n\nOutput\n\nThe output contains T integer number \u2013 the 0-based index of the last card that remains for every test case in order.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n4\n0 1\nleft right\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n\nNote\n\nNote that since Alice is starting at the beginning of the line even though her initial direction is left, on her next move she will go right.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/72", "prompt": "# Hidden Fortress\n\nThis is an interactive problem!\n\nAs part of your contribution in the Great Bubble War, you have been tasked with finding the newly built enemy fortress. The world you live in is a giant 10^9 \u00d7 10^9 grid, with squares having both coordinates between 1 and 10^9. \n\nYou know that the enemy base has the shape of a rectangle, with the sides parallel to the sides of the grid. The people of your world are extremely scared of being at the edge of the world, so you know that the base doesn't contain any of the squares on the edges of the grid (the x or y coordinate being 1 or 10^9). \n\nTo help you locate the base, you have been given a device that you can place in any square of the grid, and it will tell you the manhattan distance to the closest square of the base. The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a\u2212p|+|b\u2212q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy. Because of this, you need to make sure to never place the device inside the enemy base. \n\nUnfortunately, the device is powered by a battery and you can't recharge it. This means that you can use the device at most 40 times. \n\nInput\n\nThe input contains the answers to your queries. \n\nInteraction\n\nYour code is allowed to place the device on any square in the grid by writing \"? i j\" (1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 10^9). In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square (i,j) or -1 if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid. \n\nIf you recieve -1 instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than 40 queries. \n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \"! x y p q\" (1 \u2264 x \u2264 p\u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 q\u2264 10^9), where (x, y) is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest x and y coordinates, and (p, q) is the square inside the enemy base with the largest x and y coordinates. Note that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: \n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * See the documentation for other languages.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n? 2 2\n? 5 5\n? 4 7\n? 1 5\n! 2 3 4 5\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

The array beautifier constructs the new array in the following way: it takes two numbers at different indices from the original array and writes their sum to the end of the new array. It does this step N times - resulting in an output array of length N. During this process, the machine can take the same index multiple times in different steps. \n\nBob was very excited about the gift that his friends gave him, so he put his favorite array in the machine.

This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the value 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The second elf goes from node 2 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 3, so he remembers the value 0 (as 3 has an even number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The third elf goes from node 5 to node 6. This elf's favorite number is 7, so he remembers the value 1 (as 7 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fourth elf goes from node 6 to node 1. This elf's favorite number is 1, so he remembers the value 1 (as 1 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fifth elf goes from node 4 to node 5.

We use the size of the subtree to decide which nodes to color.\n\nHere is a Python script that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef dfs(node, parent):\n    global subtree_size\n    subtree_size[node] = 1\n    for child in tree[node]:\n        if child != parent:\n            dfs(child, node)\n            subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[child]\n\ndef solve():\n    dfs(1, 0)\n    red_nodes = sorted(subtree_size.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])\n    white_nodes = n\n    score = 0\n    for node, size in red_nodes:\n        if white_nodes - size >= k:\n            white_nodes -= size\n            score += size\n        else:\n            break\n    return white_nodes * (n - 2 * score)\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\ntree = defaultdict(list)\nfor _ in range(n - 1):\n    u, v = map(int, input().split())\n    tree[u].append(v)\n    tree[v].append(u)\nsubtree_size = [0] * (n + 1)\nprint(solve())\n```\n\nThis script reads the input, builds the tree, performs a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree, sorts the nodes by their subtree size in descending order, and then colors the nodes. The score is calculated as the product of the number of white nodes and the difference between the number of red and blue nodes.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that the input is valid and that the tree is connected. If the input may not be valid, you should add error checking code.\n", "Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef dfs(node, parent):\n    global red, blue, white\n    red[node] = 1\n    white[node] = 0\n    blue[node] = 0\n    for child in graph[node]:\n        if child != parent:\n            dfs(child, node)\n            red[node] += red[child]\n            white[node] += white[child]\n            blue[node] += blue[child]\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\ngraph = defaultdict(list)\nfor _ in range(n - 1):\n    u, v = map(int, input().split())\n    graph[u].append(v)\n    graph[v].append(u)\n\nred = [0] * (n + 1)\nblue = [0] * (n + 1)\nwhite = [0] * (n + 1)\n\ndfs(1, 0)\n\nfor node in range(1, n + 1):\n    if red[node] > k:\n        red[node] = k\n        white[node] += red[node] - k\n\nprint(white[1] * (red[1] - blue[1]))\n```\n\nThis script first reads the input and constructs the graph. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) from the root of the tree, calculating the number of red, blue, and white nodes in each subtree. It then adjusts the number of red nodes in each subtree to be at most k, and updates the number of white nodes accordingly. Finally, it calculates and prints the score of the game.\n"], "input_token_count": 1014, "output_token_counts": [580, 455, 458, 490, 393], "total_token_counts": [1594, 1469, 1472, 1504, 1407], "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "pass_rate": 0.0}

Today, you're working with a long strip, with height 1 and length n, some positions of which are occupied by 1 by 1 Lego pieces.\n\nIn one second, you can either remove two adjacent Lego pieces from the strip (if both are present), or add two Lego pieces to adjacent positions (if both are absent). You can only add or remove Lego's at two adjacent positions at the same time, as otherwise your chubby fingers run into precision issues.\n\nYou want to know exactly how much time you'll spend playing with Legos. You value efficiency, so given some starting state and some ending state, you'll always spend the least number of seconds to transform the starting state into the ending state. If it's impossible to transform the starting state into the ending state, you just skip it (so you spend 0 seconds).\n\nThe issue is that, for some positions, you don't remember whether there were Legos there or not (in either the starting state, the ending state, or both). Over all pairs of (starting state, ending state) that are consistent with your memory, find the total amount of time it will take to transform the starting state to the ending state.

{"id": "code_contests/138", "prompt": "# Trader Problem\n\nMonocarp plays a computer game (yet again!). This game has a unique trading mechanics.\n\nTo trade with a character, Monocarp has to choose one of the items he possesses and trade it for some item the other character possesses. Each item has an integer price. If Monocarp's chosen item has price x, then he can trade it for any item (exactly one item) with price not greater than x+k.\n\nMonocarp initially has n items, the price of the i-th item he has is a_i. The character Monocarp is trading with has m items, the price of the i-th item they have is b_i. Monocarp can trade with this character as many times as he wants (possibly even zero times), each time exchanging one of his items with one of the other character's items according to the aforementioned constraints. Note that if Monocarp gets some item during an exchange, he can trade it for another item (since now the item belongs to him), and vice versa: if Monocarp trades one of his items for another item, he can get his item back by trading something for it.\n\nYou have to answer q queries. Each query consists of one integer, which is the value of k, and asks you to calculate the maximum possible total cost of items Monocarp can have after some sequence of trades, assuming that he can trade an item of cost x for an item of cost not greater than x+k during each trade. Note that the queries are independent: the trades do not actually occur, Monocarp only wants to calculate the maximum total cost he can get.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m and q (1 \u2264 n, m, q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the prices of the items Monocarp has.\n\nThe third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 \u2264 b_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the prices of the items the other character has.\n\nThe fourth line contains q integers, where the i-th integer is the value of k for the i-th query (0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible total cost of items Monocarp can have after some sequence of trades, given the value of k from the query.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3 4 5\n10 30 15\n12 31 14 18\n0 1 2 3 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n55\n56\n60\n64\n64\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

They want to play the Hat k times. Thus, k games will be played at each table. Each player will play in k games.\n\nTo do this, they are distributed among the tables for each game. During each game, one player plays at exactly one table. A player can play at different tables.\n\nPlayers want to have the most \"fair\" schedule of games.

After a mine is detonated, it adds the new mines to the priority queue.

{"id": "code_contests/163", "prompt": "# Robot Cleaner Revisit\n\nThe statement of this problem shares a lot with problem A. The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not \u2261 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x \u22c5 y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 \u2264 a < 10^9 + 7 and a \u22c5 y \u2261 x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, c_d, and p (4 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^5, n, m \u2265 2, 1 \u2264 r_b, r_d \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_b, c_d \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 99) \u2014 the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot, the position of the dirt cell and the probability of cleaning in percentage.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the expected time for the robot to clean the dirty cell, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2 2 1 1 2 1 25\n3 3 1 2 2 2 25\n10 10 1 1 10 10 75\n10 10 10 10 1 1 75\n5 5 1 3 2 2 10\n97 98 3 5 41 43 50\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n3\n15\n15\n332103349\n99224487\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the robot has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second. Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same. The only difference is that the position of the dirty cell and the robot are swapped. But the movements in both cases are identical, hence the same result.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the probability of not cleaning, modulo MOD, and returns this value.\n\nThe `mod_inv` function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the Fermat's little theorem. It uses the `pow` function with three arguments to calculate the power of a number modulo another number, which is more efficient than calculating the power and then taking the modulus.\n\nThe expected time is calculated using the geometric distribution, which is the probability distribution of the number of trials needed to get one success in repeated Bernoulli trials.

The expected value of the number of trials to get one success is 1/p.\n\nThe `mod_inverse` function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number. This is used to calculate the expected time for the robot to clean the dirty cell.\n\nThe time complexity of this script is O(t), where t is the number of test cases.

{"id": "code_contests/164", "prompt": "# Middle Duplication\n\nA binary tree of n nodes is given. Nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to n and the root is the node 1. Each node can have no child, only one left child, only one right child, or both children. For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child.\n\nEach node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k. What is the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree, if we can duplicate labels of at most k nodes?\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: \n\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a \u2260 b; \n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains a string c of n lower-case English letters, where c_i is the initial label of the node i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Note that the given string c is not the initial string representation of the tree.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (0 \u2264 l_i, r_i \u2264 n). If the node i does not have the left child, l_i = 0, and if the node i does not have the right child, r_i = 0.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given input forms a binary tree, rooted at 1.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single line, containing the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree if at most k nodes have their labels duplicated.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n4 3\nabab\n2 3\n0 0\n0 4\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nbaaaab\n\nInput\n\n\n8 2\nkadracyn\n2 5\n3 4\n0 0\n0 0\n6 8\n0 7\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\ndaarkkcyan\n\nInput\n\n\n8 3\nkdaracyn\n2 5\n0 3\n0 4\n0 0\n6 8\n0 7\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\ndarkcyan\n\nNote\n\nThe images below present the tree for the examples. The number in each node is the node number, while the subscripted letter is its label. To the right is the string representation of the tree, with each letter having the same color as the corresponding node.\n\nHere is the tree for the first example. Here we duplicated the labels of nodes 1 and 3. We should not duplicate the label of node 2 because it would give us the string \"bbaaab\", which is lexicographically greater than \"baaaab\".\n\n<image>\n\nIn the second example, we can duplicate the labels of nodes 1 and 2. Note that only duplicating the label of the root will produce a worse result than the initial string.\n\n<image>\n\nIn the third example, we should not duplicate any character at all. Even though we would want to duplicate the label of the node 3, by duplicating it we must also duplicate the label of the node 2, which produces a worse result.\n\n<image>\n\nThere is no way to produce string \"darkkcyan\" from a tree with the initial string representation \"darkcyan\" :(.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.
