It uses two arrays `left` and `right` to keep track of the number of incremovable subarrays ending at each index.

Then push the current index into the stack.\n\nNext, we do the same thing but from right to left. We use a stack to keep track of the indices of elements that have been processed. For each element, while the stack is not empty and the current element is larger than the top element of the stack, pop the top element from the stack and update the left count for the popped element.

We can maintain a priority queue of pairs (num, i), where num is the number in the array and i is its index. The priority queue is ordered by num.\n\nWe start by pushing all numbers and their indices into the priority queue. Then, for each pair (num, i) in the priority queue, we check if it is possible to perform the operation on this pair. If it is possible, we perform the operation and push the new pair into the priority queue.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python3\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lexicographicallySmallestArray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> List[int]:\n        pq = [(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums)]\n        heapq.heapify(pq)\n        ans = [0] * len(nums)\n        while pq:\n            num, i = heapq.heappop(pq)\n            ans[i] = num\n            if pq:\n                new_num = num + limit if abs(num - pq[0][0]) <= limit else num - limit\n                if new_num < pq[0][0]:\n                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_num, pq[0][1]))\n        return ans\n```\n\nThis code works by first pushing all numbers and their indices into the priority queue.

The adjustment is made by either subtracting the maximum value from the maximum value (if the difference is less than or equal to the limit) or adding the limit to the maximum value (if the difference is greater than the limit). The adjusted value is then pushed back into the heap and the array.

The `for` loop iterates through all possible values of x. If the bit at position i is 1, then the bitwise XOR operation is performed on `dp[x]` with `a`. If the bit at position i is 0, then the bitwise XOR operation is performed on `dp[x]` with `b`. The maximum value is updated at each step.\n\nThe final answer is returned modulo 10^9 + 7.", "This problem can be solved using bitwise operations and dynamic programming.\n\nFirstly, we can iterate over all possible values of x from 0 to 2^n - 1.

Then it iterates over all possible values of x from 0 to 2^n - 1. For each x, it calculates the XOR of a and b with x and updates the maximum value of (a XOR x) * (b XOR x) in the dp list.

The maximum value of this product is the answer. The `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)` is calculated by subtracting the maximum value of `a` and `b` from `a` and `b`, then adding the maximum value of `a` and `b` to the result, and finally taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.", "Here is a Python solution using bitwise operations:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumXorProduct(self, a: int, b: int, n: int) -> int:\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        res = 0\n        for _ in range(n):\n            mx = max(a, b)\n            a, b = a >> 1, b >> 1\n            res = (res + ((mx & 1) << _)) % mod\n        return res\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating `n` times, and for each iteration, it finds the maximum of `a` and `b`, shifts the maximum bit to the left by `_` (which is the current bit position), and adds the result to `res`.\n\nThe maximum bit is determined by the bit at the current position in `mx`.

Then, we iterate through the sorted indices. For each index, we try to put it into a group with the smallest group. If the smallest group is full, we create a new group.\n\nThe heap stores the indices of the groups. The smallest group is the one at the front of the heap. If a group is full (the index of the front of the heap is less than the current index), we pop the group from the heap. We then push the index of the current group plus the value of the current index into the heap.\n\nFinally, we return the length of the heap, which is the minimum number of groups needed to create a valid assignment.", "This problem can be solved by using a priority queue.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python3\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minGroupsForValidAssignment(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        heap = []\n        for num in nums:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, num)\n        groups = 1\n        while len(heap) > 1:\n            if heap[0] > heap[1]:\n                heapq.heappop(heap)\n                groups += 1\n            else:\n                heapq.heappop(heap)\n                heapq.heappop(heap)\n        return groups\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first push all numbers in `nums` into a heap. Then we pop the smallest number from the heap and compare it with the next smallest number. If the smallest number is greater than the next smallest number, we pop the next smallest number and increase the number of groups. If not, we pop both numbers and continue. We repeat this process until the heap has only one number left.

This number is the number of sub-multisets with a sum within the range [l, r].\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def countSubMultisets(self, nums: List[int], l: int, r: int) -> int:\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + nums[i]\n        count = [0] * (r+1)\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            count[prefix_sum[i]] += 1\n        for i in range(l, r+1):\n            count[i] += count[i-1]\n        return sum(count[i] for i in range(l, r+1)) % mod\n```\n\nThis code first calculates the prefix sum array. Then, it counts the number of times each prefix sum occurs. Finally, it calculates the number of sub-multisets within the range [l, r] by summing up the counts of prefix sums that are less than or equal to the current prefix sum. The result is returned modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow.", "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. \n\nFirstly, we need to calculate the prefix sum of the array.

If this is the case, it means that the array is sorted in reverse order, and the number of right shifts needed is equal to the index of the first number in the array. If the array is not sorted in reverse order, it returns -1.", "Here is a Python solution using the concept of finding the first number that is smaller than the next number in the array.

If it is, then the current number is the pivot of the array. The reason we only need to check the first number that is greater than the next number is because after the pivot, the numbers will be in descending order.\n\nIf the array is already sorted in ascending order, then the answer is 0.

Then, for each element in the array, it tries to find the number of elements in the remaining part of the array that are less than the target minus the current element.

If we can't make the sum equal to x, then we can't make the sum of nums1 at any index equal to x.\n\nHere is the Python code for the solution:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumTime(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums1)\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        suffix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + nums1[i] + nums2[i]\n            suffix_sum[n - i] = suffix_sum[n - i + 1] + nums1[n - i - 1] + nums2[n - i - 1]\n        \n        dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1], suffix_sum[i] - suffix_sum[0] + prefix_sum[i])\n        \n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            if dp[i] >= x:\n                return i\n        return -1\n```\n\nIn this code, we first calculate the prefix sum and suffix sum of nums1 and nums2. Then we use dynamic programming to find the minimum sum of nums1 at each index. If the minimum sum at an index is greater than or equal to x, we return the index. If we can't find such an index, we return -1.", "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\nThe idea is to first sort the `nums1` and `nums2` arrays based on the `nums2` values. Then, we calculate the total sum of `nums1` and the minimum sum we can get by using `nums2`. If the total sum is greater than `x`, we return `-1`. Otherwise, we use dynamic programming to find the minimum time to make the sum of `nums1` less than or equal to `x`.\n\nHere is the Python code for the solution:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumTime(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        # Sort the arrays based on the nums2 values\n        nums1, nums2 = (list(i) for i in zip(*sorted(zip(nums1, nums2))))\n        \n        # Calculate the total sum of nums1\n        total_sum = sum(nums1)\n        \n        # If the total sum is greater than x, return -1\n        if total_sum > x:\n            return -1\n        \n        # Initialize the dp array\n        dp = [0] * (len(nums1) + 1)\n        \n        # Calculate the minimum sum we can get by using nums2\n        min_sum = sum(nums2)\n        \n        # Iterate over the nums1 array\n        for i in range(len(nums1)):\n            # Update the dp array\n            dp[i + 1] = min(dp[i] + nums1[i] + nums2[i], dp[i] + nums2[i])\n            \n        # Return the maximum value in the dp array\n        return max(dp)\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of `nums1`. The space complexity is O(n) for the dp array.", "This problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach.\n\nFirstly, we can sort the `nums1` and `nums2` arrays in ascending order. This is because we want to minimize the time, so we should try to decrease the maximum value as much as possible.\n\nThen, we can create a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum time to make the sum of the first `i` elements in `nums1` to be less than or equal to `j`.\n\nThe base case is `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `0 <= j <= x`.\n\nFor `i > 0` and `j > x`, we can't make the sum larger than `x`, so `dp[i][j] = inf`.\n\nFor `i > 0` and `j <= x`, we can make the sum smaller than `j` by either not using the `i-th` element or using it. The time to make the sum smaller is the maximum of `dp[i-1][k]` for `k < j`.\n\nFinally, we return the minimum `dp[n][j]` for `0 <= j <= x`. If there is no solution, we return `-1`.\n\nHere is the Python code for the solution:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumTime(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums1)\n        nums1.sort()\n        nums2.sort()\n        dp = [[0]*100010 for _ in range(1010)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(100010):\n                dp[i+1][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j])\n                if j >= nums2[i]:\n                    dp[i+1][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-nums2[i]]+nums1[i]+nums2[i])\n        for i in range(100010):\n            if dp[n][i] <= x:\n                return n - i\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n*m*x) where n is the length of `nums1`, m is the length of `nums2` and x is the given limit.", "This problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach.\n\nFirstly, we can sort the `nums1` and `nums2` arrays in ascending order. This is because we want to minimize the number of operations, so we want to start from the smallest values.\n\nNext, we initialize a `dp` array of size `nums1.length + 1`. The `dp[i]` value represents the maximum number of operations we can make using the first `i` elements of `nums1`.\n\nWe then iterate through `nums1` and `nums2`, updating the `dp` array at each index. For each index `i`, we have two options:\n\n1. We can make the current element `nums1[i]` equal to `0`. In this case, we can make the previous elements `nums1[0]`, `nums1[1]`, ..., `nums1[i-1]` equal to `0`. This is because we can make the sum of the previous elements equal to `x - nums2[i]`. Therefore, the maximum number of operations we can make using the first `i-1` elements is `dp[i-1]`.\n\n2. We can ignore the current element `nums1[i]`.

For each pair, we calculate the maximum possible length of the resulting string by taking the maximum length of the two words. We then update the minimum length of the string by taking the maximum of the current minimum length and the maximum possible length.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) due to the nested loop, where n is the number of words. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the dp array.", "This problem can be solved by using a greedy approach. The idea is to always try to join the strings with the smallest length first. We can sort the words array in ascending order by length, and then iterate over the sorted array.

The cost of inverting each character and the first character together is `i + 1`, and the cost of inverting each character and the last character together is `n - i`.\n\nFinally, you need to find the minimum cost of inverting the first character to make it equal to each character.

The idea is to iterate through the string and for each character, if it is not equal to the previous character, you can either choose to invert the previous character or the current character.

We repeat this operation k times.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python3\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximizeSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        heap = []\n        for num in nums:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -num)\n        total_sum = 0\n        for _ in range(k):\n            max_num = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n            total_sum += max_num\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -(max_num + 1))\n        return total_sum\n```\n\nThis solution works in O(n log n) time complexity due to the heap operations and O(n) space complexity due to the heap.", "Here is a Python solution using a priority queue. The idea is to keep track of the maximum element in the array and remove it and add the next element in the array to the priority queue. The priority queue will always keep the maximum element at the top. We repeat this operation k times and sum up all the elements in the priority queue.\n\n```python3\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximizeSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        heap = [-num for num in nums]\n        heapq.heapify(heap)\n        total_sum = 0\n        for _ in range(k):\n            max_num = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n            total_sum += max_num\n            if heap:\n                next_max = -heap[0]\n                if max_num > next_max:\n                    heapq.heapreplace(heap, -(max_num - 1))\n        return total_sum\n```\n\nIn the code above, we use a list comprehension to create a list of the negative of each number in `nums`. This is done because Python's heapq module uses a min heap, so we want to use a max heap. Therefore, we negate each number.\n\nWe then create a heap from the list of negative numbers and convert it to a regular heap.\n\nWe then iterate `k` times. In each iteration, we pop the maximum number from the heap and add it to `total_sum`. If the maximum number is greater than the next maximum number in the heap, we decrease the maximum number by 1 and add it back to the heap.\n\nFinally, we return `total_sum`.", "This problem can be solved using a priority queue (heap). We will iterate over the array and for each element, we will add it to the heap. We will also add the element + 1 to the heap. The heap will keep track of the maximum element seen so far.\n\nWe will remove the maximum element from the heap and add it to the score. We will repeat this process until the heap is empty and we have performed exactly `k` operations.\n\nHere is the Python code for the solution:\n\n```python3\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximizeSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        heap = []\n        for num in nums:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -num)\n\n        score = 0\n        for _ in range(k):\n            max_num = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n            score += max_num\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -(max_num + 1))\n\n        return score\n```\n\nThis solution works in O(n log n) time complexity where n is the size of the array.

Then we pop the maximum number from the heap and add it to the total sum. We also push the new maximum number + 1 into the heap. We repeat this process `k` times to get the maximum sum.", "This problem can be solved using a priority queue and greedy approach.\n\nFirstly, we iterate through the array and add all elements to a priority queue. The priority of an element is the sum of the element and its index. This is because we want to add the element with the highest sum to the array first.\n\nThen, we remove the top element from the priority queue and add it to the array. We also decrease the count of the element by 1. If the count of the element is 0, we remove the element from the priority queue.\n\nWe repeat the process until we have added 'k' elements to the array.

Finally, we return the total number of operations.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, and a space complexity of O(1).", "This problem can be solved using the concept of number theory and the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe main idea is to find the gcd of all the elements in the array. Then, to make all the elements equal to the gcd, we need to replace each element in the array with the gcd.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python3\nimport math\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        gcd = nums[0]\n        for num in nums:\n            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)\n        return len(nums) - gcd + sum(nums) - len(nums) * gcd\n```\n\nThis solution works by first finding the gcd of all the elements in the array. Then, it calculates the total number of operations needed to make all elements equal to the gcd. The total operations are the number of elements in the array minus the gcd plus the sum of all elements minus the number of elements times the gcd.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, and the space complexity is O(1).", "This problem can be solved using the concept of the greatest common divisor (gcd). The basic idea is to find the gcd of all the elements in the array and divide each element in the array by the gcd. This way, all the elements in the array will become 1.\n\nHere is a Python solution that follows the above approach:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\nimport math\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        gcd = nums[0]\n        for num in nums:\n            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)\n            if gcd == 1:\n                break\n        return len(nums) - gcd if gcd > 1 else -1\n```\n\nIn the above code, we first find the gcd of the first number and all the numbers in the array. Then, we check if the gcd is greater than 1. If it is, we return the length of the array minus the gcd, which represents the minimum number of operations to make all elements equal to 1. If the gcd is not greater than 1, we return -1, indicating that it's impossible to make all the elements equal to 1.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, and a space complexity of O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store the gcd."], "input_token_count": 607, "output_token_counts": [422, 382, 300, 265, 328], "total_token_counts": [1029, 989, 907, 872, 935], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [67.0, 143.0, 116.0, 49.0, 62.0], "average_thinking_time": 81.66666666666667}

If we can't set the bit in any number, we set it in the result.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minImpossibleOR(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        nums = set(nums)\n        ans = 1\n        for i in range(30):\n            if ans not in nums:\n                return ans\n            ans <<= 1\n        return -1\n```\n\nIn the above code, we first convert `nums` to a set for faster lookup. Then we start from 1 and keep doubling the current answer until we can't set the bit in any number. If we can't set the bit in any number, we return the answer.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) where n is the length of `nums`. The space complexity is O(1).", "This problem can be solved by using a bitwise operation.

If it is not, it means the number is not expressible, and it returns the number. If it is, it means the number is expressible, and it continues to the next iteration.
