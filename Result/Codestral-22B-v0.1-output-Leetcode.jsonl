If the last element is not equal to 0 and is not equal to the second last element, find the remainder of the division of the last element by the second last element.\n4. If the remainder is not equal to 0 and is not equal to the second last element, replace the last element with the remainder and break the loop.\n5. Return the length of the array.", " The following code implements a greedy algorithm to minimize the length of a given array of positive integers by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves selecting two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `nums[i] > 0` and `nums[j] > 0`, inserting the result of `nums[i] % nums[j]` at the end of `nums`, and then deleting the elements at indices `i` and `j` from `nums`. The goal is to find the minimum achievable length of `nums` after performing the operation any number of times.\n\nMy solution begins by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. Then, it iteratively checks for the existence of a pair of elements that satisfy the condition `nums[i] % nums[j]!= 0`. If such a pair is found, the function returns 2 because the minimum length that can be achieved is 2. If no such pair is found, it means that all elements in the array are divisible by each other, and the minimum length that can be achieved is 1.\n\nThe code is concise and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumArrayLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] % nums[0]!= 0:\n                return 2\n        return 1\n```", " The following code implements a solution to minimize the length of a given array of positive integers by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves selecting two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `nums[i] > 0` and `nums[j] > 0`, inserting the result of `nums[i] % nums[j]` at the end of the array, and then deleting the elements at indices `i` and `j`. The goal is to find the minimum achievable length of the array after performing this operation any number of times.\n\nMy solution uses a greedy approach to solve this problem. The main idea is to sort the array in non-decreasing order and iteratively apply the operation to the largest elements in the array. By doing so, we can minimize the number of operations required to reach the minimum length.\n\nThe code first checks if the length of the array is 1, in which case the minimum length is already achieved. If the array contains only 1s, the minimum length is also 1. Otherwise, the code sorts the array and initializes a variable `count` to 1, representing the current minimum length of the array. It then iterates through the sorted array, comparing each element with the previous one. If the current element is greater than the previous one and the remainder of their division is not equal to the previous element, it means that the current element cannot be further reduced, and thus, it becomes the new previous element. If the current element is equal to the previous one, it can be reduced by applying the operation, so the minimum length remains the same. If the current element is less than the previous one, it can be reduced to 0 by applying the operation, so the minimum length is decreased by 1. The code continues this process until it reaches the end of the array, at which point the minimum length is returned.\n\nHere's the full solution with comments:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumArrayLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # If the length of the array is 1, return 1\n        if len(nums) == 1:\n            return 1\n\n        # If the array contains only 1s, return 1\n        if nums.count(1) == len(nums):\n            return 1\n\n        # Sort the array in non-decreasing order\n        nums.sort()\n\n        # Initialize the minimum length to 1\n        count = 1\n\n        # Iterate through the sorted array\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            # If the current element is greater than the previous one\n            # and their remainder is not equal to the previous element,\n            # update the previous element\n            if nums[i] > nums[i - 1] and nums[i] % nums[i - 1]!= nums[i - 1]:\n                count += 1\n                nums[i - 1] = nums[i] % nums[i - 1]\n            # If the current element is equal to the previous one,\n            # the minimum length remains the same\n            elif nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:\n                continue\n            # If the current element is less than the previous one,\n            # it can be reduced to 0 by applying the operation,\n            # so the minimum length is decreased by 1\n            else:\n                count -= 1\n                break\n\n        # Return the minimum length\n        return count\n```", " ```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumArrayLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        n = len(nums)\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            if nums[i] > nums[0]:\n                nums[i] %= nums[0]\n            if nums[i] == 0:\n                return i\n        return 1\n```\n\nThe solution first sorts the array in non-decreasing order. Then, it iterates through the array from the end to the beginning. For each element, it calculates the modulo with the first element of the array.

If it is, the current element is skipped, as it can be reduced to zero by performing the operations. If it is not divisible, the current element becomes the new smallest element in the array, and the count of unique elements is incremented. The function returns the count of unique elements, which represents the minimum length of the array after performing the operations.\n\nMy solution ensures that the array is processed efficiently by sorting it initially and then iterating through it once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.

The algorithm uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the maximum number within the given constraints.\n\nThe `findMaximumNumber` function takes two arguments: `k` and `x`. It initializes the left and right boundaries of the search range, as well as the maximum number found so far.

If the length of the new number is greater than the length of the suffix `s`, the function returns immediately to avoid generating numbers that are too long.\n\nFinally, the `numberOfPowerfulInt` function returns the count of powerful integers found within the range.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfPowerfulInt(self, start: int, finish: int, limit: int, s: str) -> int:\n        res = 0\n        def dfs(num, in_range, match):\n            nonlocal res\n            if in_range:\n                res += 1\n            if match and len(num) >= len(s):\n                return\n            for i in range(limit + 1):\n                new_num = num + str(i)\n                new_in_range = in_range or int(new_num) >= start\n                new_match = match and (len(new_num) < len(s) or new_num.endswith(s))\n                dfs(new_num, new_in_range, new_match)\n        dfs(\"\", False, True)\n        return res\n```", " The following code snippet implements a solution to count the number of powerful integers within a given range. A powerful integer is defined as a positive integer that ends with a specified string `s` and has each digit less than or equal to a given limit. The solution uses a recursive function to generate all possible powerful integers and checks if they are within the given range.\n\nThe `numberOfPowerfulInt` function initializes the count of powerful integers to zero and then calls the `countPowerful` function to count the powerful integers in the range `[start, finish]`. The `countPowerful` function takes the current number as a string, the limit, and the suffix `s` as input. It checks if the current number is within the range and if it ends with the suffix `s`. If both conditions are met, it increments the count. The function then recursively calls itself with the next number in the sequence, appending digits from `0` to `limit` to the current number.\n\nTo handle the case where the current number is longer than the suffix `s`, the function checks if the current number is greater than the suffix `s` and if the remaining prefix of the current number is less than or equal to the corresponding prefix of the finish number. If both conditions are met, the function adds the number of powerful integers in the range `[prefix + s, prefix + limit * len(suffix)]` to the count, where `prefix` is the remaining prefix of the current number and `suffix` is the suffix of `s` that follows the prefix.\n\nThe function continues this process until it has checked all possible numbers within the range.

Define a recursive function `countPowerfulIntegers` that takes the current number, the length of the suffix string `s`, and the limit as parameters.\n2. In the base case, if the length of the current number is equal to the length of `s`, check if the current number is within the range `[start, finish]` and if it ends with `s`. If both conditions are true, return 1. Otherwise, return 0.\n3. In the recursive case, for each digit from 0 to `limit`, append the digit to the current number and recursively call `countPowerfulIntegers` with the updated number and the same length of `s`.\n4. Sum up the results of all the recursive calls and return the total count.\n5. Call the `countPowerfulIntegers` function with an empty string as the initial number, the length of `s`, and the limit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfPowerfulInt(self, start: int, finish: int, limit: int, s: str) -> int:\n        def countPowerfulIntegers(num: str, s_len: int, limit: int) -> int:\n            if len(num) == s_len:\n                if start <= int(num) <= finish and num.endswith(s):\n                    return 1\n                else:\n                    return 0\n\n            count = 0\n            for digit in range(limit + 1):\n                count += countPowerfulIntegers(num + str(digit), s_len, limit)\n\n            return count\n\n        return countPowerfulIntegers(\"\", len(s), limit)\n```\nI have implemented the solution in Python.

The function then defines a helper function `dfs` that generates all possible powerful integers by recursively appending digits to the current number being constructed. The base case for the recursion is when the length of the current number equals the length of `s`, in which case the function checks if the number is within the range and updates the count accordingly.

A special substring is defined as a string made up of only a single character. The solution employs a sliding window approach to iterate through the string and keep track of the count of each character in the current window. The algorithm maintains a maximum length variable that is updated whenever a special substring of length at least three is encountered.\n\nThe code begins by initializing a maximum length variable to -1, which will be returned if no special substring occurs at least three times. It then iterates through the string, using two pointers, `start` and `end`, to define the current window. Within the loop, it checks if the current window is a special substring by comparing the count of the first character in the window with the length of the window. If the counts match, it means the window is a special substring. The code then updates the maximum length if the current window's length is greater than the current maximum length and if the count of the first character in the window is at least three.\n\nThe loop continues to expand the window by incrementing the `end` pointer until the window is no longer a special substring. At this point, the `start` pointer is incremented to shrink the window and continue the search for special substrings.

The function initializes an empty stack and iterates through the string using a while loop. For each character in the string, the code checks if the stack is empty or if the current character is different from the top character in the stack. If either condition is true, the code appends the count and index of the current character to the stack. If the current character is the same as the top character in the stack, the code increments the count of the top character in the stack.\n\nAfter iterating through the string, the code appends a sentinel value to the stack to simplify the calculation of the longest special substring.

The algorithm used is a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.\n\nThe code begins by creating a graph where each node represents a character in the alphabet, and each edge represents a possible transformation with its corresponding cost. This graph is represented as an adjacency list, where `graph[i]` contains a list of tuples `(j, cost)`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `j` with a cost of `cost`.\n\nThe code then initializes a `dist` array to store the minimum cost to reach each node from the source node. It also creates a `visited` set to keep track of the nodes that have been visited. The algorithm starts by setting the distance to the source node as 0 and the distance to all other nodes as infinity.\n\nThe main loop of the algorithm iterates through all the nodes in the graph, selecting the unvisited node with the smallest distance. It then updates the distances to all its neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found. This process is repeated until all nodes have been visited.\n\nFinally, the code calculates the minimum cost to convert the source string to the target string by summing up the minimum cost to transform each character in the source string to the corresponding character in the target string.

It initializes `dp[0]` as 1, as there is always one way to partition an array of length 1.\n\nFor each index `i` from 1 to the length of the array, the code calculates the number of good partitions ending at that index by considering all possible partitions that can be formed by splitting the array at index `j` (where `j` ranges from the beginning of the current partition to `i`). If the current partition does not contain any number that appears in the previous partition, it adds the number of good partitions ending at index `j - 1` to `dp[i]`.\n\nFinally, the code returns the last element of the `dp` array, which represents the total number of good partitions in the array.

This bitwise AND is used as a mask to track which numbers have been encountered so far. The code also keeps track of the maximum value of the mask encountered during the iteration.\n\nAfter processing the entire array, the code initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with the same length as the input array, where `dp[i]` represents the number of good partitions ending at index `i`. The base case is that each single element is a good partition, so `dp[0]` is initialized to 1.

By the end of the iteration, the minimum number of operations needed to remove all adjacent almost-equal characters from the string is stored in the `odd` counter, as the last character must be placed at an odd index to avoid adjacent almost-equal characters.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def removeAlmostEqualCharacters(self, word: str) -> int:\n        odd, even = 0, 0\n        for i in range(len(word)):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                if i > 0 and abs(ord(word[i]) - ord(word[i - 1])) <= 1:\n                    even += 1\n                else:\n                    odd = min(odd, even + 1)\n            else:\n                if i > 0 and abs(ord(word[i]) - ord(word[i - 1])) <= 1:\n                    odd += 1\n                else:\n                    even = min(even, odd + 1)\n        return min(odd, even)\n```", " The following code implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of removing adjacent almost-equal characters from a given string `word`. The function `removeAlmostEqualCharacters` takes a string `word` as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired string with no adjacent almost-equal characters.\n\nThe solution is based on the observation that we can divide the string into two groups: characters that are at even indices and characters that are at odd indices. Since we can change any character to any lowercase English letter, we can ensure that there are no adjacent almost-equal characters by making the characters at even indices different from the characters at odd indices.\n\nTo implement this, the code iterates through the string and keeps track of the minimum number of operations required for both even and odd indices. For each character, it calculates the cost of making the current character different from the previous character and adds it to the minimum cost of the opposite index. This ensures that the current character is different from the previous character in the final string. The minimum of the two costs is then stored as the new minimum cost for the current index.\n\nFinally, the function returns the minimum of the two final minimum costs, which represents the minimum number of operations required to remove all adjacent almost-equal characters from the input string.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def removeAlmostEqualCharacters(self, word: str) -> int:\n        n = len(word)\n        even_cost, odd_cost = 0, 0\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                if i > 0 and abs(ord(word[i]) - ord(word[i - 1])) <= 1:\n                    even_cost += 1\n                else:\n                    even_cost = min(even_cost, odd_cost)\n            else:\n                if abs(ord(word[i]) - ord(word[i - 1])) <= 1:\n                    odd_cost += 1\n                else:\n                    odd_cost = min(even_cost, odd_cost)\n\n        return min(even_cost, odd_cost)\n```", " The following code snippet is a solution to the problem of removing adjacent almost-equal characters from a given string. The algorithm employed here is a greedy approach that iterates through the string, comparing each character with its adjacent character. If they are almost equal, the code calculates the cost of changing one of them to a different character, and keeps track of the total cost. The cost is calculated as the minimum of two possible operations: changing the current character or changing the next character. The total cost is then updated accordingly, and the loop continues to the next pair of characters. This process ensures that the minimum number of operations required to remove all adjacent almost-equal characters is found. The code returns the total cost as the final result.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def removeAlmostEqualCharacters(self, word: str) -> int:\n        total_cost = 0\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(word) - 1:\n            if abs(ord(word[i]) - ord(word[i + 1])) <= 1:\n                total_cost += 1\n                i += 2\n            else:\n                i += 1\n        return total_cost\n```", " The following code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the minimum number of operations required to remove all adjacent almost-equal characters from a given string. The algorithm works by iterating through the string and calculating the minimum number of operations needed to remove adjacent almost-equal characters for each substring ending at the current index. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is optimal and that the minimum number of operations is found for each substring.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The `removeAlmostEqualCharacters` function takes a string `word` as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to remove adjacent almost-equal characters.\n\n2. The function initializes a list `dp` of size equal to the length of the word, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations needed to remove adjacent almost-equal characters from the substring `word[0:i+1]`.\n\n3. The function then iterates through the string, comparing each character with its adjacent characters. If an adjacent character is almost-equal, the function calculates the minimum number of operations needed to remove the adjacent character and updates `dp[i]` accordingly.\n\n4. Finally, the function returns the value of `dp[-1]`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to remove adjacent almost-equal characters from the entire string.\n\nThe code uses a helper function `is_almost_equal` to check if two characters are almost-equal. This function returns `True` if the characters are equal or if their ASCII values differ by at most 1, and `False` otherwise.\n\nOverall, the code provides an efficient solution to the problem using dynamic programming and a helper function to check for almost-equal characters.\n```python3\ndef removeAlmostEqualCharacters(word: str) -> int:\n    def is_almost_equal(a: str, b: str) -> bool:\n        return ord(a) == ord(b) or abs(ord(a) - ord(b)) == 1\n\n    n = len(word)\n    dp = [0] * n\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]\n        if is_almost_equal(word[i], word[i - 1]):\n            if i >= 2:\n                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 2])\n            dp[i] += 1\n\n    return dp[-1]\n```", " The following code snippet is designed to solve the problem of removing adjacent almost-equal characters from a given string with the minimum number of operations.

The cost is calculated based on the parity of the index, as changing characters at even and odd indices have different impacts on the overall string.

Here's the full solution with step-by-step comments in Python:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countCompleteSubstrings(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize variables\n        n, count, left, right, unique_chars = len(word), 0, 0, 0, 0\n        freq = [0] * 26\n\n        # Iterate over the string\n        while right < n:\n            # Expand the window to the right\n            if unique_chars <= 2 or (unique_chars == 3 and (freq[ord(word[right]) - ord('a') - 1] == k or freq[ord(word[right]) - ord('a') + 1] == k)):\n                if freq[ord(word[right]) - ord('a')] == 0:\n                    unique_chars += 1\n                freq[ord(word[right]) - ord('a')] += 1\n                if freq[ord(word[right]) - ord('a')] == k:\n                    unique_chars -= 1\n                right += 1\n            # Contract the window from the left\n            else:\n                if freq[ord(word[left]) - ord('a')] == k:\n                    unique_chars += 1\n                freq[ord(word[left]) - ord('a')] -= 1\n                if freq[ord(word[left]) - ord('a')] == 0:\n                    unique_chars -= 1\n                left += 1\n            # Update the count of complete substrings\n            if right - left >= k and unique_chars == 0:\n                count += right - left - k + 1\n\n        return count\n```\nTo solve this problem, the code employs a sliding window approach that maintains a window of characters within the input string. The window is expanded to the right by adding characters to it and contracted from the left by removing characters from it. The key to this approach is the use of a frequency dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each character within the window and a variable to count the number of unique characters. The algorithm iteratively expands the window to the right as long as the completeness condition is met, and then contracts it from the left to find new complete substrings. The count of complete substrings is updated whenever a new complete substring is found. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as each character is processed once.", " The following code implements a sliding window approach to solve the problem of counting complete substrings in a given input string. A complete substring is defined as a non-empty contiguous sequence where each character occurs exactly `k` times, and the difference between two adjacent characters is at most `2`. The solution iterates through the string, maintaining a count of each character within the current window. It checks if the window is valid (i.e., all characters occur exactly `k` times and the difference between adjacent characters is at most `2`). If the window is valid, it increments a counter and then expands the window to the right by adding the next character. If the window becomes invalid, it contracts the window from the left by removing the leftmost character until the window becomes valid again. This process continues until the end of the string is reached.\n\nMy solution ensures that all substrings of length up to the current window size are considered, as the contraction step may make the window valid again after removing some characters from the left. The time complexity of the algorithm is linear, as each character is processed once. Here is my implementation of this approach:\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def countCompleteSubstrings(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:\n        count = [0] * 26\n        left = 0\n        res = 0\n        for right in range(len(word)):\n            count[ord(word[right]) - ord('a')] += 1\n            while count[ord(word[right]) - ord('a')] > k:\n                count[ord(word[left]) - ord('a')] -= 1\n                left += 1\n            while left < right and (count[ord(word[left]) - ord('a')] < k or ord(word[left + 1]) - ord(word[left]) > 2):\n                count[ord(word[left]) - ord('a')] -= 1\n                left += 1\n            if right - left + 1 >= k:\n                res += right - left + 1 - k + 1\n        return res\n```"], "input_token_count": 470, "output_token_counts": [374, 650, 712, 762, 478], "total_token_counts": [844, 1120, 1182, 1232, 948], "thinking_time": [100.0, 212.0, 143.0, 140.0, 159.0], "average_thinking_time": 147.33333333333334, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "pass_rate": 0.0}

The condition is that the absolute difference between the elements at the two indices being swapped should be less than or equal to a given limit.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a combination of sorting and bucket sort. The main idea is to sort the numbers and their indices together, and then iterate through the sorted list to place each number in its correct position in the output list. To do this, we use a bucket sort-like approach where each bucket represents a range of numbers that can be swapped with each other. We maintain a queue for each bucket to keep track of the indices that can be filled with numbers from that bucket.\n\nThe code first sorts the numbers and their indices together. Then, it initializes the output list and a list of queues, one for each bucket. It then iterates through the sorted list of numbers and indices, placing each number in its correct position in the output list by finding the appropriate bucket and taking the index from the front of the corresponding queue. After placing a number, it updates the bucket of the next index that can be filled and adds it to the back of the queue.\n\nThis approach ensures that the output list is lexicographically smallest because it always places the smallest number that can be placed in the current position. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted list of numbers and indices and the queues.\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lexicographicallySmallestArray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(nums)\n        sorted_nums = sorted((num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums))\n        ans = [0] * n\n        queues = [deque() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        for num, i in sorted_nums:\n            bucket = bisect_left(sorted_nums, (num - limit, -1))\n            ans[queues[bucket].popleft()] = num\n            next_bucket = bisect_left(sorted_nums, (num - limit + 1, -1))\n            queues[next_bucket].append(i)\n\n        return ans\n```", " To solve this problem, we can use the concept of buckets and sorting.

The algorithm uses a prefix sum approach to efficiently calculate the number of beautiful substrings.\n\nThe solution begins by initializing a list `prefix` to store the prefix sum of the difference between the counts of vowels and consonants in the string. This is done by iterating through the string and updating the prefix sum based on whether the current character is a vowel or a consonant.\n\nNext, a dictionary `count` is used to store the frequency of each prefix sum. This allows us to count the number of occurrences of each prefix sum, which is crucial for determining the number of beautiful substrings.\n\nThe algorithm then iterates through the prefix sum list, and for each element, it calculates the number of beautiful substrings ending at that position. This is done by checking the remainder of the division of the current prefix sum by `k`. If the remainder is zero, it means that the product of the counts of vowels and consonants up to this position is divisible by `k`, and therefore, all substrings ending at this position with a prefix sum equal to the current prefix sum are beautiful. The count of such substrings is added to the total count.\n\nAdditionally, the code keeps track of the frequency of each prefix sum in the `count` dictionary, which will be used to calculate the number of beautiful substrings in the remaining part of the string.\n\nFinally, the total count of beautiful substrings is returned as the result.

At each position, it checks if setting the bit in both `a` and `b` would result in a larger product than leaving it unset. This decision is based on the observation that if a bit is set in both `a` and `b`, then flipping this bit in `x` will increase the product, as long as the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` are not already equal.

The decision is made based on whether flipping the bit would result in a larger product. The algorithm keeps track of the maximum product that can be obtained at each bit position for both `a` and `b` using a dynamic programming approach. The final result is the maximum product obtained after iterating through all bit positions.\n\nMy solution uses a recursive function `dp` that takes four arguments: `a`, `b`, `n`, and a mask that represents the current bit position being considered. The function returns a tuple containing the maximum product that can be obtained for `a` and `b` at the current bit position. The base case for the recursion is when `n` becomes zero, in which case the function returns a tuple containing the product of `a` and `b` with the current mask.\n\nThe function first checks if the result for the current `a`, `b`, `n`, and mask has already been computed and stored in the `memo` dictionary.

The function then recursively calls itself with the new mask and the current bit position for both `a` and `b`. The function then calculates the product of the results of the recursive calls and compares it to the current maximum product. If the product is larger, the maximum product is updated.\n\nFinally, the function stores the maximum product for the current `a`, `b`, `n`, and mask in the `memo` dictionary and returns it as a tuple. The main function `maximumXorProduct` initializes the `memo` dictionary and calls the `dp` function with the initial values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and a mask of zero.

If it is possible, we add the number of ways to distribute the remaining candies to the total count.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:\n        total_ways = 0\n        for first_child in range(min(n, limit) + 1):\n            remaining = n - first_child\n            second_child_min = max(0, first_child + 1 - limit)\n            second_child_max = min(remaining, limit)\n            total_ways += max(0, second_child_max - second_child_min + 1)\n        return total_ways\n```\n\nI will now execute this code to check if it produces the correct results.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:\n        total_ways = 0\n        for first_child in range(min(n, limit) + 1):\n            remaining = n - first_child\n            second_child_min = max(0, first_child + 1 - limit)\n            second_child_max = min(remaining, limit)\n            total_ways += max(0, second_child_max - second_child_min + 1)\n        return total_ways\n\n# Test the function with example inputs\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.distributeCandies(5, 2))\nprint(solution.distributeCandies(3, 3))\n```", " ```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:\n        total = 0\n        for a in range(min(n, limit) + 1):\n            for b in range(min(n - a, limit) + 1):\n                c = n - a - b\n                if c <= limit:\n                    total += 1\n        return total\n```\n\nThe solution iterates through all possible combinations of candies distributed to the first two children (a and b) and checks if the remaining candies (c) can be distributed to the third child without exceeding the limit.

The idea is to count the number of valid distributions of candies among the three children.\n\nA valid distribution is one where no child gets more than the given limit of candies. We can iterate through all possible numbers of candies for the first child (from 0 to min(limit, n)) and then iterate through all possible numbers of candies for the second child (from 0 to min(limit, n - firstChildCandies)). The remaining candies will be distributed to the third child.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Initialize a variable `totalWays` to 0 to keep track of the total number of valid distributions.\n2. Iterate through all possible numbers of candies for the first child from 0 to min(limit, n).\n3. For each number of candies for the first child, iterate through all possible numbers of candies for the second child from 0 to min(limit, n - firstChildCandies).\n4.

Add the cost to the `total_spending`.\n8. If there are still items left in the shop from which we bought the item, add the next item from that shop to the priority queue.\n9. Return the `total_spending` as the maximum amount of money that can be spent.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappush, heappop\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSpending(self, values: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Step 1: Initialize priority queue\n        pq = []\n        for i in range(len(values)):\n            for j in range(len(values[i])):\n                heappush(pq, (-values[i][j], i, j))\n\n        # Step 3: Initialize total spending\n        total_spending = 0\n\n        # Step 4: Iterate through the days\n        for day in range(1, len(values) * len(values[0]) + 1):\n            # Step 5: Remove item with highest value from priority queue\n            value, shop_index, item_index = heappop(pq)\n\n            # Step 6: Calculate cost and add to total spending\n            total_spending += -value * day\n\n            # Step 8: Add next item from the shop to priority queue\n            if item_index + 1 < len(values[shop_index]):\n                heappush(pq, (-values[shop_index][item_index + 1], shop_index, item_index + 1))\n\n        # Step 9: Return total spending\n        return total_spending\n```\nI have implemented the solution in Python. The `maxSpending` function takes a 2D list `values` as input, where each row represents a shop and each column represents an item in the shop. The function returns the maximum amount of money that can be spent on buying all the items.\n\nNow, let's test the function with the given examples to see if it produces the correct output.\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\n\nvalues = [[8,5,2],[6,4,1],[9,7,3]]\nprint(solution.maxSpending(values))\n\nvalues = [[10,8,6,4,2],[9,7,5,3,2]]\nprint(solution.maxSpending(values))\n```", " To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the maximum value item that can be bought from each shop. We start by adding all the rightmost items from each shop into the priority queue. Then, we iterate from day 1 to the total number of items (m * n), and in each iteration, we remove the maximum value item from the priority queue, calculate the cost of buying it on the current day, and add it to the total spending. After that, we add the next item from the same shop to the priority queue, if it exists.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSpending(self, values: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        m, n = len(values), len(values[0])\n        pq = []\n        for i in range(m):\n            heapq.heappush(pq, (-values[i][-1], i, n - 1))\n\n        total_spending = 0\n        for day in range(1, m * n + 1):\n            value, shop, item = heapq.heappop(pq)\n            total_spending += -value * day\n            if item > 0:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (-values[shop][item - 1], shop, item - 1))\n\n        return total_spending\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m * n * log(m)), where m is the number of shops and n is the number of items in each shop. This is because we iterate through all m * n items and perform a log(m) operation for each iteration to add or remove items from the priority queue. The space complexity is O(m), which is the space used to store the priority queue.", " To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue (max heap) to keep track of the maximum value item that can be bought from each shop. We start by adding the rightmost item from each shop to the priority queue. On each day, we buy the item with the maximum value from the priority queue and add the next item from the same shop to the priority queue. We repeat this process until we have bought all the items. The total spending is the sum of the prices of all the bought items.\n\nHere is the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:\n\n1. Initialize a priority queue (max heap) to store tuples of the form `(-value, shop_index, item_index)`. The negative sign is used to make the priority queue a max heap.\n2. Add the rightmost item from each shop to the priority queue.\n3. Initialize a variable `total_spending` to 0.\n4. For `m * n` days, do the following:\n   a. Remove the item with the maximum value from the priority queue.\n   b. Add the price of the item to `total_spending`.\n   c. If there are more items in the same shop, add the next item from the shop to the priority queue.\n5. Return `total_spending`.\n\nI will now implement this algorithm in Python and run the code to get the result.\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport heapq\n\ndef maxSpending(values: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n    m, n = len(values), len(values[0])\n    max_heap = []\n\n    # Add the rightmost item from each shop to the priority queue\n    for i in range(m):\n        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-values[i][n-1], i, n-1))\n\n    total_spending = 0\n    day = 1\n\n    # For m * n days\n    for _ in range(m * n):\n        # Remove the item with the maximum value from the priority queue\n        value, shop_index, item_index = heapq.heappop(max_heap)\n\n        # Add the price of the item to total_spending\n        total_spending += -value * day\n\n        # If there are more items in the same shop\n        if item_index > 0:\n            # Add the next item from the shop to the priority queue\n            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-values[shop_index][item_index-1], shop_index, item_index-1))\n\n        day += 1\n\n    return total_spending\n```\n```python\nvalues = [[8,5,2],[6,4,1],[9,7,3]]\nmaxSpending(values)\n```", " To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue (max heap) to keep track of the maximum value item that can be bought from each shop.

Initially, we will set `dp[i]` equal to `nums[i]`.\n\nFor each index `i`, we will iterate through all the previous indices `j` (from 0 to `i-1`) and check if the subsequence `nums[j:i+1]` is balanced. If it is balanced, we will update `dp[i]` with the maximum sum of the subsequence ending at index `i` and the sum of the subsequence `nums[j:i+1]`.\n\nFinally, we will return the maximum value in the `dp` array as the maximum possible sum of elements in a balanced subsequence of `nums`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef maxBalancedSubsequenceSum(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    n = len(nums)\n    dp = [0] * n\n    dp[0] = nums[0]\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        dp[i] = nums[i]\n        for j in range(i):\n            if nums[i] - nums[j] >= i - j:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + nums[i])\n\n    return max(dp)\n```\nI have implemented the solution in Python.

If no such substring exists, it returns an empty string.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestBeautifulSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        n = len(s)\n        shortest = s + '1'  # Initialize shortest with a string larger than any possible substring\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            ones = 0\n            for j in range(i, n):\n                if s[j] == '1':\n                    ones += 1\n                if ones == k:\n                    substring = s[i:j + 1]\n                    if len(substring) < len(shortest):\n                        shortest = substring\n                    elif len(substring) == len(shortest) and substring < shortest:\n                        shortest = substring\n\n        return shortest if shortest!= s + '1' else ''\n```\nThe code first initializes `shortest` to a string that is lexicographically larger than any possible substring of `s`. It then iterates through all possible substrings of `s` using two nested loops. The outer loop `i` iterates through the starting indices of the substrings, and the inner loop `j` iterates through the ending indices. For each substring, it counts the number of `1`'s and checks if it equals `k`. If it does, the substring is compared to the current shortest beautiful substring found so far. If the substring is lexicographically smaller and of the same length, or if it is shorter, it becomes the new shortest beautiful substring. Finally, the function returns the shortest beautiful substring found, or an empty string if no such substring exists.", " To solve this problem, I will iterate through all possible substrings of the given binary string `s` and check if the number of `1`'s in each substring is equal to `k`. I will keep track of the shortest beautiful substring found so far and update it if a shorter beautiful substring is found. If multiple shortest beautiful substrings are found, I will return the lexicographically smallest one.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1. Initialize an empty string `shortest_substring` to store the shortest beautiful substring found so far.\n2. Iterate through all possible substrings of `s` using two nested loops. The outer loop will iterate from the start of the string to the end, and the inner loop will iterate from the current position of the outer loop to the end of the string.\n3. For each substring, count the number of `1`'s in it.\n4. If the count of `1`'s is equal to `k`, check if the length of the substring is smaller than the length of the current `shortest_substring`. If it is, update `shortest_substring` with the current substring. If the length is equal, compare the current substring with `shortest_substring` lexicographically and update `shortest_substring` if the current substring is lexicographically smaller.\n5. After iterating through all substrings, return `shortest_substring`.\n\nI will now implement this plan in the `shortestBeautifulSubstring` function.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestBeautifulSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        shortest_substring = \"\"\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            for j in range(i, len(s)):\n                substring = s[i:j+1]\n                if substring.count('1') == k:\n                    if len(substring) < len(shortest_substring) or (len(substring) == len(shortest_substring) and substring < shortest_substring):\n                        shortest_substring = substring\n        return shortest_substring\n```\nI have implemented the `shortestBeautifulSubstring` function according to the plan.

The solution is based on the observation that the problem can be reduced to finding the number of subsets with a sum equal to a target value, which can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\nThe code defines a function `countSubMultisets` that takes in the list of numbers `nums`, and the lower and upper bounds `l` and `r` as input. The function first calculates the total sum of the numbers in the list and initializes a modulo value to `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers. It then creates a list `dp` of size `total_sum + 1`, initialized with 0s, to store the number of subsets with a sum equal to each index. The first element of `dp` is set to 1, as there is exactly one way to form a subset with a sum of 0 (by taking no elements).\n\nThe code then iterates through each number `num` in the input list `nums`. For each number, it creates a copy of the current `dp` list, `dp_new`, and updates `dp_new` using a sliding window approach. It iterates through each index `i` from `num` to `total_sum`, and for each index, it adds the number of subsets with a sum equal to `i - num` to the number of subsets with a sum equal to `i`. This is because for each number `num`, we have two choices: either include it in the subset or exclude it. If we include it, we need to find the number of subsets with a sum equal to the remaining target value, which is `i - num`.

The approach is based on dynamic programming and uses a modulo operation to handle large numbers.\n\nThe code defines a function `countSubMultisets` that takes three arguments: `nums`, `l`, and `r`. Inside the function, a constant `MOD` is defined for the modulo operation to keep the results within a manageable range. The function then initializes a list `dp` with a length of `r + 1`, where each element is initialized to 0. The `dp` list is used to store the count of sub-multisets that sum up to a specific value.\n\nThe function then iterates through each number in the `nums` list and updates the `dp` list using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates in reverse order from `r` to the current number, and the inner loop iterates from the current number to 0. For each iteration, the `dp` list is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - num]` to `dp[j]`, where `j` is the current index and `num` is the current number. This update represents the addition of the current number to the sub-multisets that sum up to `j - num`.\n\nAfter updating the `dp` list for all numbers in `nums`, the function calculates the total sum of `nums` and initializes a variable `ans` to 0. If the total sum is less than `l`, the function returns `ans` as there are no valid sub-multisets. Otherwise, the function iterates from `l` to `r` and adds the value of `dp[i]` to `ans` for each iteration.\n\nFinally, the function returns `ans` modulo `MOD` to ensure the result is within the required range.

The `remainder_map` is used to handle the case where the target sum can be achieved by a subarray that wraps around the end of the original array and continues from the beginning.\n\nThe algorithm then iterates through the array, updating the `prefix_sum` and calculating the current remainder with respect to the target. If the current remainder is zero, it means that a subarray starting from the beginning of the array sums up to the target, and the length of this subarray is updated as the minimum size.\n\nThe core of the algorithm is the handling of the remainder. If the current remainder is not zero and it exists in the `remainder_map`, it indicates that there is a subarray ending at the current index with a sum equal to the target. The length of this subarray is calculated and compared to the current minimum size. If a shorter subarray is found, the minimum size is updated.\n\nFinally, if the current remainder is not in the `remainder_map`, it is added to the map with its index. This step ensures that the algorithm considers the possibility of wrapping around the array when searching for a subarray with the target sum.\n\nThe algorithm continues this process for two iterations through the array to account for the potential wrapping of the subarray.

This approach ensures that we collect the minimum number of elements necessary to obtain the desired range, as we prioritize elements that are closer to the end of the array.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        collected = set()\n        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):\n            if 1 <= nums[i] <= k:\n                collected.add(nums[i])\n            if len(collected) == k:\n                return len(nums) - i\n```", " The following code implements a solution to find the minimum number of operations required to collect elements from 1 to k from a given array of positive integers.

The algorithm iterates through the input array twice, once from left to right and once from right to left, to calculate the maximum sum of heights for each possible peak. The final result is the maximum of these sums.\n\nMy solution involves creating two arrays, `left` and `right`, to store the maximum sum of heights for each possible peak from the left and right sides, respectively.

The maximum sum of such a subset is the answer to the problem.\n\nMy solution uses a dictionary to store the prime factorization of each number and a set to keep track of the unique prime factors. The function `factorize` is used to find the prime factors of a given number. The `maximumSum` function then iterates through each unique prime factor, calculates the sum of the numbers with an odd number of occurrences of that prime factor, and updates the maximum sum accordingly. Finally, it returns the maximum sum.\n```python3\nfrom collections import defaultdict, Counter\n\ndef factorize(n):\n    i = 2\n    factors = []\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            n //= i\n            factors.append(i)\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        factor_count = defaultdict(int)\n        unique_factors = set()\n        for num in nums:\n            factors = factorize(num)\n            for factor in factors:\n                factor_count[factor] += 1\n                unique_factors.add(factor)\n\n        max_sum = 0\n        for factor in unique_factors:\n            sum_of_nums = sum(num for num in nums if factor_count[factor] % 2)\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, sum_of_nums)\n\n        return max_sum\n```", " To solve this problem, we can use the concept of prime factorization and dynamic programming.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of each number in the given array. Then, we iterate through all possible subsets of indices and calculate the element-sum for each complete subset. A complete subset is a subset where the product of every pair of its elements is a perfect square. To check if a subset is complete, we check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the subset is greater than 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, then the subset is complete.\n\nWe use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum element-sum of a complete subset. We define a dp array where dp[i] represents the maximum element-sum of a complete subset ending at index i. We iterate through all possible subsets ending at index i and update dp[i] accordingly.\n\nFinally, we return the maximum value in the dp array as the result.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom math import gcd\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [0] * n\n        primes = defaultdict(list)\n\n        # Find prime factorization of each number\n        for i in range(n):\n            num = nums[i]\n            j = 2\n            while j * j <= num:\n                if num % j == 0:\n                    primes[j].append(i)\n                    while num % j == 0:\n                        num //= j\n                j += 1\n            if num > 1:\n                primes[num].append(i)\n\n        # Calculate maximum element-sum of a complete subset\n        for prime, indices in primes.items():\n            if len(indices) == 1:\n                dp[indices[0]] = nums[indices[0]]\n            else:\n                max_sum = 0\n                for i in indices:\n                    max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i])\n                for i in indices:\n                    dp[i] = max_sum + nums[i]\n\n        return max(dp)\n```\nI have implemented the solution in Python.

If the stack is empty or the top element of the stack is less than the current element, we push the current element onto the stack. Otherwise, we continue to the next element, effectively removing elements from the array.\n\nThe minimum length of the array is then the size of the stack after processing all elements. If the stack size is odd, we subtract one from the size to account for the fact that we cannot have a single element left in the array after the operation.\n\nMy solution ensures that the stack always contains elements in a way that allows for further removals, leading to the minimum possible length of the array.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minLengthAfterRemovals(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        stack = []\n        for num in nums:\n            if not stack or stack[-1] < num:\n                stack.append(num)\n        return max(0, len(stack) - 1) if len(stack) % 2 else len(stack)\n```"], "input_token_count": 818, "output_token_counts": [524, 493, 551, 497, 338], "total_token_counts": [1342, 1311, 1369, 1315, 1156], "thinking_time": [125.0, 114.0, 197.0, 68.0, 62.0], "average_thinking_time": 102.33333333333333, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "pass_rate": 0.0}

The `prefix_function` calculates the prefix function for a given string, which is used to find the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix of the string. The `solve` function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to transform string `s` into string `t` in `k` operations. The `is_rotation` function checks if `t` is a rotation of `s`. If `t` is not a rotation of `s`, the function returns 0. If `k` is a multiple of the length of `s`, the function returns 1.

Return the `max_sum` after iterating through the entire array.\n\nThe code below implements this algorithm and returns the maximum sum of almost unique subarrays of length `k` in `nums`.\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSum(self, nums: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:\n        max_sum = 0\n        freq = {}\n        window_sum = 0\n\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            # Add the current element to the window\n            window_sum += nums[i]\n            freq[nums[i]] = freq.get(nums[i], 0) + 1\n\n            # Check if the window size is equal to k\n            if i >= k - 1:\n                # Check if the window contains at least m distinct elements\n                if len(freq) >= m:\n                    max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)\n\n                # Remove the leftmost element from the window\n                window_sum -= nums[i - k + 1]\n                freq[nums[i - k + 1]] -= 1\n                if freq[nums[i - k + 1]] == 0:\n                    del freq[nums[i - k + 1]]\n\n        return max_sum\n```", " To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We'll maintain a window of size `k` and calculate the sum of its elements. We'll also keep track of the count of unique elements in the window. If the count of unique elements is greater than or equal to `m`, we'll update the maximum sum. We'll slide the window by removing the leftmost element and adding the rightmost element in the next iteration.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Initialize variables: `max_sum` to store the maximum sum, `window_sum` to store the sum of the current window, and `count` to store the count of unique elements in the current window.\n2. Iterate through the array `nums` using a sliding window approach:\n   - Add the current element to the `window_sum`.\n   - If the count of unique elements in the window is less than `m`, increment the count of the current element in a frequency dictionary.\n   - If the size of the window is equal to `k`, check if the count of unique elements is greater than or equal to `m`. If it is, update the `max_sum` with the maximum of `max_sum` and `window_sum`.\n   - If the size of the window is greater than `k`, remove the leftmost element from the window by decrementing its count in the frequency dictionary and subtracting it from the `window_sum`.\n3. Return the `max_sum`.\n\nLet's implement this in code:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSum(self, nums: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:\n        max_sum = 0\n        window_sum = 0\n        count = 0\n        freq = {}\n\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            window_sum += nums[i]\n\n            if nums[i] not in freq:\n                freq[nums[i]] = 1\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                freq[nums[i]] += 1\n\n            if i >= k:\n                left_element = nums[i - k]\n                freq[left_element] -= 1\n                if freq[left_element] == 0:\n                    count -= 1\n                window_sum -= left_element\n\n            if i >= k - 1 and count >= m:\n                max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)\n\n        return max_sum\n```\nI have implemented the solution in Python. The `maxSum` function takes in three parameters: `nums`, `m`, and `k`. It initializes the `max_sum` variable to 0, `window_sum` to 0, and `count` to 0. It also initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window.\n\nThe function then iterates through the `nums` array using a sliding window approach. In each iteration, it adds the current element to the `window_sum` and updates the frequency dictionary `freq`. If the count of unique elements in the window is less than `m`, it increments the count. If the size of the window is greater than `k`, it removes the leftmost element from the window by decrementing its count in the frequency dictionary and subtracting it from the `window_sum`. If the size of the window is equal to `k` and the count of unique elements is greater than or equal to `m`, it updates the `max_sum` with the maximum of `max_sum` and `window_sum`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `max_sum`.\n\nI will now run a test case to verify the implementation.\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\nnums = [2, 6, 7, 3, 1, 7]\nm = 3\nk = 4\nsolution.maxSum(nums, m, k)\n```", " To solve this problem, I will use a sliding window approach.

At each iteration, I will remove the leftmost element from the window and update its frequency in the dictionary. If the frequency becomes zero, I will remove the element from the dictionary. Finally, I will return the maximum sum.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this approach:\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef maxSum(nums, m, k):\n    # Initialize variables\n    max_sum = 0\n    window_sum = 0\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n\n    # Iterate through the array\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        # Add the current element to the window\n        window_sum += nums[i]\n        freq[nums[i]] += 1\n\n        # If the window size is greater than k, remove the leftmost element\n        if i >= k:\n            window_sum -= nums[i - k]\n            freq[nums[i - k]] -= 1\n            if freq[nums[i - k]] == 0:\n                del freq[nums[i - k]]\n\n        # If the window size is equal to k and the number of distinct elements is greater than or equal to m, update the maximum sum\n        if i >= k - 1 and len(freq) >= m:\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)\n\n    return max_sum\n```\nI have implemented the `maxSum` function that takes in an integer array `nums`, two positive integers `m`, and `k`, and returns the maximum sum out of all almost unique subarrays of length `k` of `nums`.\n\nNow, I will test the function with the given examples to see if it produces the correct output.\n```python\nprint(maxSum([2,6,7,3,1,7], 3, 4))\nprint(maxSum([5,9,9,2,4,5,4], 1, 3))\nprint(maxSum([1,2,1,2,1,2,1], 3, 3))\n```"], "input_token_count": 684, "output_token_counts": [811, 406, 643, 919, 561], "total_token_counts": [1495, 1090, 1327, 1603, 1245], "thinking_time": [57.0, 59.0, 96.0, 46.0, 133.0], "average_thinking_time": 70.66666666666667, "results": [false, false, true, true, false], "pass_rate": 0.4}

The algorithm works by iterating through the array and, for each element, it checks if the target can be reduced by subtracting the current element. If it can, the target is reduced. If it can't, the current element is divided by 2 and added to the count of operations. This process continues until the target becomes 0 or less, or until all elements in the array have been processed. If the target is still greater than 0 after processing all elements, the function returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to obtain a subsequence that sums up to the target.\n\nMy solution follows this approach, using a while loop to iterate through the array and an if-else structure to handle the two possible outcomes of each iteration. The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, as each element is processed once. The space complexity is O(1), as only a constant amount of additional space is used to store the count of operations.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        operations = 0\n        i = 0\n        while target > 0 and i < len(nums):\n            if target >= nums[i]:\n                target -= nums[i]\n            else:\n                operations += nums[i] // 2\n                nums[i] //= 2\n                continue\n            i += 1\n        return -1 if target > 0 else operations + (target + 1) // 2\n```", " The following code implements a greedy algorithm to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations to form a subsequence with a target sum from a given array of non-negative powers of 2. The algorithm works by iterating through the array and performing operations to maximize the contribution of larger elements towards the target sum. The code uses a counter to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array and then iterates through the powers of 2 in descending order. For each power, it checks if the target can be reduced by subtracting the current power and, if so, it does so while updating the counter and the number of operations. If the target becomes zero, the algorithm returns the number of operations; otherwise, it continues to the next smaller power.

The algorithm employs a greedy approach to construct the array by selecting the smallest possible distinct positive integers that do not sum up to `k`.

If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, we can fill the array with the first `n` numbers, as they will not sum up to `k`. If `k` is greater than `n`, we need to exclude numbers that would cause a sum of `k` when paired with any number in the array. This is achieved by skipping the numbers in the range `[k - n + 1, k - 1]` when constructing the array.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), as it iterates through the range `[1, n]` once to construct the array.

The approach is to first calculate the number of pairs that would sum up to `k` if they were in the array. This is done by dividing `k` by 2 and checking if it is less than or equal to `n`. If it is, then that many pairs can be formed.\n\nThe minimum sum is then calculated by first summing up the first `n` positive integers, which can be done using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. If there are any pairs that sum up to `k`, we subtract the larger number of each pair from the total sum to ensure that no two numbers in the array add up to `k`. However, since we want the minimum sum, we only subtract the difference between the larger number and `k/2` once, as this difference is the minimum value that needs to be removed to avoid the pair summing up to `k`.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumSum(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:\n        # Calculate the number of pairs that sum up to k\n        pairs_count = min(n, (k - 1) // 2)\n\n        # Calculate the sum of the first n positive integers\n        total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n\n        # Subtract the minimum value that needs to be removed to avoid pairs summing up to k\n        total_sum -= pairs_count * (k - pairs_count)\n\n        return total_sum\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `pairs_count` and `total_sum`.", " The following code implements a solution to find the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length `n`.

If `k` is odd, we include `k/2` in the count as well. Then, we calculate the sum of these elements and add the remaining elements that are greater than `k/2` to the sum.

Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nMy code implements this algorithm efficiently to solve the problem.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def canMakeSubsequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:\n        i, j, matched = 0, 0, 0\n        while i < len(str1) and j < len(str2):\n            if str1[i] == str2[j]:\n                i += 1\n                j += 1\n                matched += 1\n            elif i + 1 < len(str1) and (str1[i + 1] == str2[j] or chr((ord(str1[i + 1]) - ord('a') + 1) % 26 + ord('a')) == str2[j]):\n                i += 1\n                j += 1\n                matched += 1\n            else:\n                i += 1\n        return matched == len(str2)\n```", " The following code snippet is a solution to the problem of determining whether it's possible to make a string `str2` a subsequence of `str1` by performing a cyclic increment operation on `str1` at most once. The algorithm uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate through `str1` and `str2` respectively. The main idea is to check if each character in `str2` can be found in `str1` by either matching the characters directly or by matching the characters after a cyclic increment. The code also handles the case where the cyclic increment wraps around from 'z' to 'a'. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to 0. These pointers will be used to traverse `str1` and `str2` respectively.\n2. Iterate through `str1` using the pointer `i`.\n3. For each character in `str1`, check if it matches the current character in `str2` (pointed to by `j`). If it does, increment `j` to move to the next character in `str2`.\n4. If the characters don't match directly, check if the cyclic increment of the current character in `str1` matches the current character in `str2`. If it does, increment `j` to move to the next character in `str2`.\n5. If neither the current character in `str1` nor its cyclic increment matches the current character in `str2`, continue to the next character in `str1`.\n6. After the loop, check if `j` has reached the end of `str2`. If it has, it means that all characters in `str2` have been found in `str1` as a subsequence, so return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.\n\nThe code below implements this algorithm and returns `True` if `str2` is a subsequence of `str1` after at most one cyclic increment operation, and `False` otherwise.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def canMakeSubsequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:\n        i, j = 0, 0\n        while i < len(str1) and j < len(str2):\n            if str1[i] == str2[j] or chr(ord(str1[i]) + 1) == str2[j] or (str1[i] == 'z' and str2[j] == 'a'):\n                j += 1\n            i += 1\n        return j == len(str2)\n```"], "input_token_count": 622, "output_token_counts": [232, 452, 574, 527, 597], "total_token_counts": [854, 1074, 1196, 1149, 1219], "thinking_time": [127.0, 113.0, 142.0, 40.0, 80.0], "average_thinking_time": 106.66666666666667, "results": [false, false, false, false, true], "pass_rate": 0.2}

The main function `numberOfBeautifulIntegers` converts the lower and upper limits of the range into lists of digits and calls the `dp` function to calculate the number of beautiful integers within the range.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfBeautifulIntegers(self, low: int, high: int, k: int) -> int:\n        def dp(n, even, odd, rem, tight, memo):\n            if n == 0:\n                return even == odd and rem == 0\n            if not tight and (n, even, odd, rem) in memo:\n                return memo[(n, even, odd, rem)]\n            up = high[n - 1] if tight else 9\n            ans = 0\n            for d in range(up + 1):\n                ans += dp(n - 1, even + (d % 2 == 0), odd + (d % 2 == 1), (rem * 10 + d) % k, tight and d == up, memo)\n            if not tight:\n                memo[(n, even, odd, rem)] = ans\n            return ans\n\n        low_digits = list(map(int, str(low - 1)))\n        high_digits = list(map(int, str(high)))\n        return dp(len(high_digits), 0, 0, 0, True, {}) - dp(len(low_digits), 0, 0, 0, True, {})\n```", " The following code snippet is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful integers within a given range. A beautiful integer is defined as a number that has an equal count of even and odd digits and is divisible by a given positive integer `k`. The solution employs a dynamic programming approach to efficiently calculate the number of beautiful integers within the range.\n\nThe code defines a class `Solution` with a method `numberOfBeautifulIntegers` that takes three arguments: `low`, `high`, and `k`. The method first converts the `low` and `high` bounds into lists of their digits for further processing. It then initializes a 3D dynamic programming array `dp` to store the intermediate results. The dimensions of the array are based on the number of digits in `high`, the count of even and odd digits, and the remainder when dividing by `k`.\n\nThe code then iterates through the digits of the numbers, updating the `dp` array based on the possible digits that can be appended to the current number while maintaining the beautiful integer properties. The final result is obtained by summing up the values in the `dp` array that correspond to beautiful integers within the given range.\n\nThe following code implements this algorithm and returns the count of beautiful integers within the specified range.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfBeautifulIntegers(self, low: int, high: int, k: int) -> int:\n        def countBeautiful(num: List[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(num)\n            dp = [[[0] * k for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n            dp[0][0][0] = 1\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(i + 1):\n                    for p in range(k):\n                        for d in range(10):\n                            ni = i + 1\n                            nj = j + (d % 2)\n                            np = (p * 10 + d) % k\n                            dp[ni][nj][np] += dp[i][j][p]\n\n            return sum(dp[n][i][0] for i in range(n + 1))\n\n        low_digits = [int(d) for d in str(low - 1)]\n        high_digits = [int(d) for d in str(high)]\n        return countBeautiful(high_digits) - countBeautiful(low_digits)\n```", " To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to count the number of beautiful integers in the given range.\n\nWe will define a function `countBeautiful` that takes three arguments: `num`, `mask`, and `rem`. `num` represents the current number being considered, `mask` represents the bitmask that keeps track of the count of even and odd digits, and `rem` represents the remainder of `num` when divided by `k`.\n\nThe base case for the recursion is when `num` is 0. In this case, we check if `mask` is equal to 0 (which means the count of even and odd digits is equal) and if `rem` is equal to 0 (which means the number is divisible by `k`). If both conditions are true, we return 1, indicating that we have found a beautiful integer. Otherwise, we return 0.\n\nFor the recursive case, we iterate through each digit of `num` from left to right. For each digit, we calculate the new remainder `newRem` when the current digit is appended to the right of `rem`. We then recursively call `countBeautiful` with the updated `num`, `mask`, and `newRem`.\n\nTo optimize the solution, we can use memoization to store the results of subproblems. This way, we avoid redundant calculations and improve the efficiency of the solution.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the number of beautiful integers in the given range by subtracting the count of beautiful integers less than `low` from the count of beautiful integers less than or equal to `high`.\n\nI will now implement this solution in Python and execute the code.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfBeautifulIntegers(self, low: int, high: int, k: int) -> int:\n        def countBeautiful(num: int, mask: int, rem: int, memo: dict) -> int:\n            if num == 0:\n                return 1 if mask == 0 and rem == 0 else 0\n\n            if (num, mask, rem) in memo:\n                return memo[(num, mask, rem)]\n\n            count = 0\n            for digit in range(10):\n                newNum = num * 10 + digit\n                newMask = mask ^ (1 << digit)\n                newRem = (rem * 10 + digit) % k\n                count += countBeautiful(newNum // 10, newMask, newRem, memo)\n\n            memo[(num, mask, rem)] = count\n            return count\n\n        memo = {}\n        countHigh = countBeautiful(high, 0, 0, memo)\n        countLow = countBeautiful(low - 1, 0, 0, memo)\n\n        return countHigh - countLow\n```\nI have implemented the solution in Python. The `numberOfBeautifulIntegers` function takes three arguments: `low`, `high`, and `k`. It uses a helper function `countBeautiful` to count the number of beautiful integers in a given range.\n\nThe `countBeautiful` function uses dynamic programming with memoization to optimize the solution. It takes three arguments: `num`, `mask`, and `rem`. `num` represents the current number being considered, `mask` represents the bitmask that keeps track of the count of even and odd digits, and `rem` represents the remainder of `num` when divided by `k`.\n\nThe function recursively iterates through each digit of `num` from left to right, calculates the new remainder `newRem`, and recursively calls `countBeautiful` with the updated `num`, `mask`, and `newRem`. The results of subproblems are stored in a memoization dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nFinally, the `numberOfBeautifulIntegers` function calculates the number of beautiful integers in the given range by subtracting the count of beautiful integers less than `low` from the count of beautiful integers less than or equal to `high`.\n\nI will now execute the code with some test cases to verify its correctness.\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\n\n# Test case 1\nlow = 10\nhigh = 20\nk = 3\noutput = solution.numberOfBeautifulIntegers(low, high, k)\noutput\n```"], "input_token_count": 608, "output_token_counts": [660, 724, 509, 591, 1007], "total_token_counts": [1268, 1332, 1117, 1199, 1615], "thinking_time": [111.0, 126.0, 133.0, 89.0, 138.0], "average_thinking_time": 123.33333333333333, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "pass_rate": 0.0}

Here's my solution:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minAbsoluteDifference(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        window = sorted((nums[i], i) for i in range(x))\n        min_diff = float('inf')\n\n        for i in range(x, len(nums)):\n            min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(nums[i] - window[bisect_left(window, (nums[i], i)) - 1][0]))\n            bisect.insort(window, (nums[i], i))\n            if window[0][1] <= i - x:\n                window.pop(0)\n\n        return min_diff\n```\nThe `minAbsoluteDifference` function takes in a list of integers `nums` and an integer `x` as input. It initializes the `window` variable with the first `x` elements of `nums`, sorted by their values and indices. The `min_diff` variable is set to infinity to ensure that any valid difference will be smaller.\n\nThe function then iterates through the rest of the `nums` list. For each element, it calculates the absolute difference between the current element and the largest element in the window that is still within the distance constraint. It updates `min_diff` with the smaller of the current minimum difference and the calculated difference.\n\nThe window is then updated by inserting the current element into its sorted position and removing the smallest element if it is no longer within the distance constraint. This is done using the `bisect.insort` function to maintain the sorted order of the window and the `pop` method to remove the first element.\n\nFinally, the function returns the minimum difference found during the iteration."], "input_token_count": 582, "output_token_counts": [245, 380, 244, 477, 526], "total_token_counts": [827, 962, 826, 1059, 1108], "thinking_time": [135.0, 151.0, 257.0, 243.0, 149.0], "average_thinking_time": 181.0, "results": [false, false, false, true, false], "pass_rate": 0.2}

The core of the algorithm is a segment tree data structure, which allows for efficient range queries and updates. In this context, the segment tree is used to store the maximum prime score and the corresponding index in each range of the array.\n\nThe code begins by defining a `SegmentTree` class that encapsulates the segment tree functionality. This class includes methods for building the tree from the input array, querying the maximum prime score and its index in a given range, and updating the tree when a new maximum is found.\n\nThe `Solution` class contains the main logic for the problem. It first initializes a `SegmentTree` object with the input array. It then iterates `k` times, each time performing the following steps:\n\n1. Query the segment tree to find the maximum prime score and its index in the entire array.\n2. Remove the subarray up to the found index from the segment tree to prevent reusing it in future operations.\n3.

The code uses a dictionary to keep track of the indices at which each unique element appears, and then iterates through this dictionary to calculate the maximum distance. The minimum of these maximum distances is the solution to the problem. Here's a brief explanation of the steps involved:\n\n1.

The `minimumString` function returns the lexicographically smallest string among all possible merged strings.", " The following code snippet is designed to solve a problem that involves finding the shortest string that contains three given strings as substrings. The solution uses a brute force approach to generate all possible combinations of merging the three strings in different orders and orientations. The code then checks each combination to see if it contains all three strings as substrings. If a valid combination is found, it is added to a list of candidates. The function then returns the lexicographically smallest string from the list of candidates.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. Define a helper function `merge` that takes two strings and merges them in a way that minimizes the length of the resulting string while ensuring that the first string is a substring of the result.\n2. Define a function `minimumString` that takes three strings as input and initializes an empty list `ans` to store the candidate strings.\n3. Generate all possible combinations of merging the three strings in different orders and orientations using nested loops and the `merge` function.\n4. For each combination, check if it contains all three strings as substrings. If it does, add it to the list of candidates.\n5. If the list of candidates is empty, return the lexicographically smallest string that is formed by concatenating the three input strings in their original order.\n6. Otherwise, return the lexicographically smallest string from the list of candidates.\n\nThe code uses a brute force approach, so it may not be efficient for large input strings. However, since the constraints of the problem limit the length of the input strings to 100 characters or less, the code should be able to find the solution within a reasonable amount of time.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def merge(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:\n        n, m = len(a), len(b)\n        for i in range(min(n, m), 0, -1):\n            if a.endswith(b[:i]):\n                return a + b[i:]\n        return a + b\n\n    def minimumString(self, a: str, b: str, c: str) -> str:\n        ans = []\n        for a, b, c in (a, b, c), (a, c, b), (b, a, c), (b, c, a), (c, a, b), (c, b, a):\n            s = self.merge(self.merge(a, b), c)\n            if a in s and b in s and c in s:\n                ans.append(s)\n        if not ans:\n            return a + b + c\n        return min(ans)\n```", " To solve this problem, we can check all possible combinations of merging the three strings in different orders and return the lexicographically smallest string that contains all three strings as substrings.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.

For example, `base[1] = [1, 1]` and `base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]`.\n\n\nReturn `true` *if the given array is good, otherwise return*`false`.\n\n\n**Note:** A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [2, 1, 3]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].

It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [1, 1]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. Therefore, the answer is true.\n```\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4.

This solution ensures that the operation is applied optimally and efficiently to achieve the desired result.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def checkArray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:\n        n = len(nums)\n        min_val = [0] * n\n        min_val[0] = nums[0]\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            min_val[i] = min(min_val[i - 1], nums[i] - (i >= k) * min_val[i - k])\n            if min_val[i] < 0:\n                return False\n\n        return True\n```", " To solve this problem, I will use a greedy approach.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def longestAlternatingSubarray(self, nums: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        max_length = 0\n        i = 0\n        while i < n:\n            if nums[i] % 2 == 0 and nums[i] <= threshold:\n                j = i + 1\n                while j < n and nums[j] % 2!= nums[j - 1] % 2 and nums[j] <= threshold:\n                    j += 1\n                max_length = max(max_length, j - i)\n                i = j\n            else:\n                i += 1\n        return max_length\n```", " ```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def longestAlternatingSubarray(self, nums: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:\n        max_length = 0\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(nums):\n            if nums[i] % 2 == 0 and nums[i] <= threshold:\n                start = i\n                while i + 1 < len(nums) and nums[i] % 2!= nums[i + 1] % 2 and nums[i + 1] <= threshold:\n                    i += 1\n                max_length = max(max_length, i - start + 1)\n            i += 1\n        return max_length\n```\n\nThe solution iterates through the array and checks for the starting point of a valid subarray. Once a starting point is found, it expands the subarray as long as the alternating condition and threshold condition are satisfied. The length of the longest valid subarray is kept track of and returned at the end.", " To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the length of the current subarray that satisfies the given conditions. We start by checking if the first element of the array is even and less than or equal to the threshold. If it is, we initialize a variable `max_length` to 1 and a variable `current_length` to 1.\n\nThen, we iterate through the array starting from the second element. For each element, we check if it satisfies the conditions: it should have a different parity than the previous element and be less than or equal to the threshold. If it does, we increment `current_length` by 1. Otherwise, we reset `current_length` to 1 if the current element is even and less than or equal to the threshold, or 0 otherwise.\n\nAt each step, we update `max_length` with the maximum value between its current value and `current_length`.\n\nFinally, we return `max_length` as the length of the longest subarray that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestAlternatingSubarray(self, nums: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:\n        max_length = 0\n        current_length = 0\n\n        if nums[0] % 2 == 0 and nums[0] <= threshold:\n            current_length = 1\n            max_length = 1\n\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] % 2!= nums[i - 1] % 2 and nums[i] <= threshold:\n                current_length += 1\n            else:\n                if nums[i] % 2 == 0 and nums[i] <= threshold:\n                    current_length = 1\n                else:\n                    current_length = 0\n\n            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)\n\n        return max_length\n```\n\nI will now run a test case to validate the implementation.\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestAlternatingSubarray(self, nums: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:\n        max_length = 0\n        current_length = 0\n\n        if nums[0] % 2 == 0 and nums[0] <= threshold:\n            current_length = 1\n            max_length = 1\n\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] % 2!= nums[i - 1] % 2 and nums[i] <= threshold:\n                current_length += 1\n            else:\n                if nums[i] % 2 == 0 and nums[i] <= threshold:\n                    current_length = 1\n                else:\n                    current_length = 0\n\n            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)\n\n        return max_length\n\nsolution = Solution()\nnums = [3, 2, 5, 4]\nthreshold = 5\nsolution.longestAlternatingSubarray(nums, threshold)\n```"], "input_token_count": 676, "output_token_counts": [651, 306, 316, 241, 762], "total_token_counts": [1327, 982, 992, 917, 1438], "thinking_time": [95.0, 43.0, 65.0, 34.0, 34.0], "average_thinking_time": 47.333333333333336, "results": [true, true, true, true, true], "pass_rate": 1.0}

A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices `i` and `j` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`, and the first digit of `nums[i]` and the last digit of `nums[j]` are coprime. To achieve this, I have implemented a function called `countBeautifulPairs` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the total number of beautiful pairs.\n\nThe code begins by initializing a variable `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs found. It then iterates through the list using two nested loops. The outer loop selects the index `i`, and the inner loop selects the index `j`. For each pair of indices, the code extracts the first digit of `nums[i]` and the last digit of `nums[j]`. It then checks if these two digits are coprime by calculating their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the `math.gcd` function. If the GCD is equal to 1, the pair is considered beautiful, and the `count` variable is incremented.\n\nFinally, the code returns the total count of beautiful pairs found in the list. This solution ensures that all possible pairs are considered, and the coprimality condition is checked for each pair to determine its beauty.\n```python3\nimport math\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countBeautifulPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):\n                first_digit = int(str(nums[i])[0])\n                last_digit = int(str(nums[j])[-1])\n                if math.gcd(first_digit, last_digit) == 1:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n```"], "input_token_count": 818, "output_token_counts": [420, 342, 1081, 310, 460], "total_token_counts": [1238, 1160, 1899, 1128, 1278], "thinking_time": [115.0, 77.0, 62.0, 16.0, 35.0], "average_thinking_time": 58.0, "results": [true, false, false, true, true], "pass_rate": 0.6}

Then, it initializes an empty list, `result`, to store the number of idle servers for each query.\n\nFor each query, the code performs two binary searches: one to find the index of the first request that falls within the time interval `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]`, and another to find the index of the last request that falls within the same interval. The difference between these two indices gives the number of servers that received requests within the interval. Subtracting this number from the total number of servers `n` yields the number of idle servers, which is then appended to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the number of idle servers for each query.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        result = []\n        for q in queries:\n            left = bisect_left(logs, [0, q - x + 1], key=lambda x: x[1])\n            right = bisect_right(logs, [0, q], key=lambda x: x[1])\n            result.append(n - (right - left))\n        return result\n```"], "input_token_count": 670, "output_token_counts": [581, 436, 511, 509, 468], "total_token_counts": [1251, 1106, 1181, 1179, 1138], "thinking_time": [73.0, 101.0, 52.0, 137.0, 127.0], "average_thinking_time": 100.33333333333333, "results": [false, false, true, false, false], "pass_rate": 0.2}

The `maximumSumQueries` method takes three parameters: `nums1`, `nums2`, and `queries`.

The problem statement involves two arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, and a list of queries, each with a pair of values `(xi, yi)`. For each query, the task is to find the maximum value of `nums1[j] + nums2[j]` where `nums1[j] >= xi` and `nums2[j] >= yi`. If no such index `j` exists, the result for that query is `-1`.\n\nThe solution uses a segment tree data structure to efficiently answer range maximum queries. The segment tree is built based on the sorted values of `nums1[j] - nums2[j]` and the corresponding `nums1[j] + nums2[j]`. The segment tree allows for quick retrieval of the maximum `nums1[j] + nums2[j]` for a given range of `nums1[j] - nums2[j]` values.\n\nThe code begins by creating a list of pairs, each containing the difference and sum of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`. This list is then sorted in descending order based on the difference. Queries are also sorted in descending order based on `xi`. The segment tree is then initialized with the sorted pairs.\n\nThe main loop iterates through the sorted queries. For each query, the code performs a binary search to find the largest index in the sorted pairs that satisfies the query condition. If such an index is found, the maximum sum in the range of that index to the end of the array is retrieved from the segment tree and added to the `answer` list. If no such index is found, `-1` is added to the `answer` list.\n\nThe segment tree is implemented using a list where each index corresponds to a node in the tree. The `update` function updates the value of a node in the tree, and the `query` function retrieves the maximum value in a range of the tree. The `build` function is used to construct the segment tree from the sorted pairs.\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O((n + q) log n), where n is the length of the input arrays and q is the number of queries. This is because the pairs are sorted, the queries are sorted, and both operations take O(n log n) time. The segment tree operations take O(log n) time, and there are O(q) of them. Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting operations. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the pairs and the segment tree.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumSumQueries(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        pairs = sorted((a - b, a + b) for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2))\n        queries = sorted((x, y, i) for i, (x, y) in enumerate(queries))\n        ans = [-1] * len(queries)\n        st = [0] * (2 * len(pairs))\n\n        def update(i: int, val: int) -> None:\n            i += len(pairs)\n            st[i] = max(st[i], val)\n            while i > 1:\n                i >>= 1\n                st[i] = max(st[i << 1], st[i << 1 | 1])\n\n        def query(l: int, r: int) -> int:\n            l += len(pairs)\n            r += len(pairs)\n            res = 0\n            while l < r:\n                if l & 1:\n                    res = max(res, st[l])\n                    l += 1\n                if r & 1:\n                    res = max(res, st[r - 1])\n                l >>= 1\n                r >>= 1\n            return res\n\n        def build(pairs: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:\n            for diff, _ in pairs:\n                update(bisect_left(st, diff), 0)\n            for i, (diff, total) in enumerate(pairs):\n                update(i, total)\n\n        build(pairs)\n        j = len(pairs) - 1\n        for x, y, i in queries[::-1]:\n            while j >= 0 and pairs[j][0] >= x and pairs[j][1] >= y:\n                update(j, pairs[j][1])\n                j -= 1\n            if j >= 0:\n                ans[i] = query(0, j + 1)\n        return ans\n```", " The following code implements a solution to the Maximum Sum Queries problem using a combination of sorting and a segment tree data structure.

The length of the longest semi-repetitive substring is updated at each step.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:\n        left = 0\n        right = 0\n        repeated_count = 0\n        max_length = 0\n\n        while right < len(s):\n            if right > 0 and s[right] == s[right - 1]:\n                repeated_count += 1\n\n            while repeated_count > 1:\n                if s[left] == s[left + 1]:\n                    repeated_count -= 1\n                left += 1\n\n            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n            right += 1\n\n        return max_length\n```\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

A set, `seen`, is used to store the characters within this window. The `right` pointer is moved one step at a time, and for each new character, the code checks if it is already in the `seen` set.

It iterates through all possible subsets of rows and calculates the maximum number of set bits in each column that satisfy the condition. The `dp` array stores the maximum number of set bits for each subset, and the `prev` array stores the previous subset that leads to the current maximum. Finally, it reconstructs the good subset from the `prev` array and returns the row indices.", " The following code snippet is designed to solve a problem involving finding a good subset of rows in a binary matrix. A good subset is defined as a non-empty set of rows where the sum of each column is at most half of the length of the subset. The code uses a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.\n\nThe main function `goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix` takes a 2D binary matrix `grid` as input and returns a list of row indices that form a good subset. If there are multiple good subsets, the function can return any of them. If there are no good subsets, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe code first checks for any rows that contain only zeros. If such a row is found, it is added to the result list as it can always be included in a good subset. The function then initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with a size equal to 2^n, where n is the number of columns in the matrix. Each bit in the `dp` array represents whether a subset of rows can be formed with a sum of columns less than or equal to half the length of the subset for that particular bit configuration.\n\nThe code then iterates through each row of the matrix and calculates the bitmask representation of that row. It then iterates through all possible subsets that can be formed by including or excluding the current row and updates the `dp` array accordingly.\n\nFinally, the code iterates through the `dp` array in reverse order to find the largest subset that can be formed. If such a subset is found, the function returns the row indices that correspond to the set bits in the bitmask. If no good subset is found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m * 2^n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because the code iterates through each row and each possible subset of rows. The space complexity is O(2^n), which is the size of the `dp` array.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(grid[0])\n        dp = [0] * (1 << n)\n        dp[0] = 1\n        last = [-1] * (1 << n)\n        ans = []\n\n        for row in grid:\n            mask = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if row[i]:\n                    mask |= (1 << i)\n\n            for i in range((1 << n) - 1, mask - 1, -1):\n                if dp[i - mask]:\n                    dp[i] = 1\n                    last[i] = mask\n\n        for i in range((1 << n) - 1, -1, -1):\n            if dp[i]:\n                mask = i\n                while mask:\n                    ans.append(last[mask])\n                    mask ^= last[mask]\n                break\n\n        return [i for i in range(len(grid)) if (1 << i) & sum(ans) > 0]\n```", " To solve this problem, I will iterate through each row of the matrix and check if the sum of each column of the current row is at most half of the length of the current row.

This is because we iterate through all possible subsets of rows and for each subset, we calculate the bitwise OR of all the rows and check if the number of set bits is at most half of the length of the subset.

The result is the sum of the distance of the first element from the beginning and the distance of the last element from the end, subtracted by 1 to account for the overlap when both elements are adjacent.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def semiOrderedPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        first_one = nums.index(1)\n        last_n = n - 1 - nums[::-1].index(n)\n        return first_one + (n - 1 - last_n) - (1 if first_one < last_n else 0)\n```\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we perform a linear scan of the array to find the indices of the first occurrence of 1 and the last occurrence of `n`. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the indices and the length of the array.", " The following code snippet provides a solution to the problem of finding the minimum number of swaps required to make a given permutation semi-ordered, i.e., to have the first element as 1 and the last element as n. The algorithm works by first locating the positions of the first and last elements in the permutation. It then calculates the number of swaps needed to bring the first element to the start and the last element to the end. However, if the first element is at the end and the last element is at the start, a special case arises where one less swap is needed because swapping these two elements will automatically place them in the correct positions. The code implements this logic and returns the minimum number of swaps required.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def semiOrderedPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        first_pos = nums.index(1)\n        last_pos = nums.index(n)\n\n        if first_pos > last_pos:\n            return first_pos + (n - 1 - last_pos) - 1\n        else:\n            return first_pos + (n - 1 - last_pos)\n```", " To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the given permutation `nums`. Let's call this index `i`.\n2. Find the index of the last occurrence of `n` in the given permutation `nums`. Let's call this index `j`.\n3. The minimum number of operations required to make `nums` a semi-ordered permutation is the sum of the following two values:\n   - The number of operations required to move `1` to the first position, which is `i` (since swapping adjacent elements takes one operation).\n   - The number of operations required to move `n` to the last position, which is `len(nums) - 1 - j` (since swapping adjacent elements takes one operation).\n4. However, if `i` is less than `j`, we need to subtract 1 from the sum because swapping `1` and `n` will be counted twice.\n5. Return the minimum number of operations.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def semiOrderedPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        i = nums.index(1)\n        j = nums.index(n)\n        return i + (n - 1 - j) - (1 if i < j else 0)\n```\nI have implemented the `semiOrderedPermutation` function according to the steps described above. Now, I will run a few test cases to validate the implementation.\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\n\n# Test case 1\nnums = [2, 1, 4, 3]\nprint(solution.semiOrderedPermutation(nums))\n# Expected output: 2\n\n# Test case 2\nnums = [2, 4, 1, 3]\nprint(solution.semiOrderedPermutation(nums))\n# Expected output: 3\n\n# Test case 3\nnums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]\nprint(solution.semiOrderedPermutation(nums))\n# Expected output: 0\n```", " ```python\nclass Solution:\n    def semiOrderedPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        first = nums.index(1)\n        last = nums.index(n)\n        if first > last:\n            return first + n - 1 - last - 1\n        else:\n            return first + n - 1 - last\n```\n\nThe solution first finds the indices of the first and last elements in the permutation. If the first element is after the last element, the minimum number of swaps required is the sum of the index of the first element and the difference between the length of the permutation and the index of the last element, minus 1. If the first element is before the last element, the minimum number of swaps required is the sum of the index of the first element and the difference between the length of the permutation and the index of the last element. The solution then returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the permutation semi-ordered.", " The following code snippet implements a solution to find the minimum number of operations required to transform a given permutation into a semi-ordered permutation. A semi-ordered permutation is defined as one where the first element is 1 and the last element is n. The code identifies the positions of the first and last elements in the permutation and calculates the number of swaps needed to bring them to their correct positions. However, since the first element must be swapped to the front first, and the last element must be swapped to the end last, an adjustment is made to the total number of swaps if both elements are not already in their correct positions. This ensures that the minimum number of operations is returned.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def semiOrderedPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        first_one = nums.index(1)\n        last_n = n - 1 - nums[::-1].index(n)\n\n        if first_one > last_n:\n            return first_one + (n - 1) - last_n - 1\n        else:\n            return first_one + (n - 1) - last_n\n```"], "input_token_count": 673, "output_token_counts": [332, 280, 537, 237, 285], "total_token_counts": [1005, 953, 1210, 910, 958], "thinking_time": [50.0, 63.0, 52.0, 20.0, 57.0], "average_thinking_time": 53.0, "results": [false, true, false, true, true], "pass_rate": 0.6}

The `total` variable keeps the overall count of adjacent elements with the same color. The code also handles edge cases where the index is at the beginning or end of the array. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. Initialize an array `colors` of size `n` to store the color of each element, with all elements initially uncolored (0).\n2. Initialize an empty array `answer` to store the count of adjacent elements with the same color after each query.\n3.

The results are stored in an output list that is returned at the end.\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def getSubarrayBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:\n        # Initialize frequency count array for negative numbers\n        freq = [0] * 51\n        # Initialize output list\n        output = []\n\n        # Iterate through the array\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            # Add current number to frequency count\n            if nums[i] < 0:\n                freq[nums[i] + 50] += 1\n\n            # If window size is reached\n            if i >= k - 1:\n                # Initialize count of negative numbers\n                count = 0\n                # Iterate through frequency count array\n                for j in range(50, -1, -1):\n                    # If current frequency is greater than 0\n                    if freq[j] > 0:\n                        # Increment count\n                        count += 1\n                        # If count is equal to x\n                        if count == x:\n                            # Append beauty to output list\n                            output.append(j - 50)\n                            # Break loop\n                            break\n                # If count is less than x\n                if count < x:\n                    # Append 0 to output list\n                    output.append(0)\n\n                # Remove leftmost number from frequency count\n                if nums[i - k + 1] < 0:\n                    freq[nums[i - k + 1] + 50] -= 1\n\n        # Return output list\n        return output\n```", " The following code implements a sliding window approach to solve the problem of finding the beauty of each subarray of size `k` in a given integer array `nums`. The beauty of a subarray is defined as the `x`th smallest negative integer in the subarray if it contains at least `x` negative integers, or 0 otherwise. The code uses a multiset data structure to efficiently keep track of the negative integers in the current window and find the `x`th smallest negative integer.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n\n1. Import the `SortedList` class from the `sortedcontainers` module to use as a multiset data structure.\n2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the beauty of each subarray.\n3. Initialize an empty `SortedList` `window` to store the negative integers in the current window.\n4. Iterate over the elements in `nums` using a sliding window approach:\n   a. If the current element is negative, add it to the `window`.\n   b. If the size of the `window` is greater than `x`, remove the leftmost element from the `window`.\n   c. If the size of the `window` is equal to `x`, append the `x`th smallest negative integer in the `window` to the `result` list. If the `window` contains fewer than `x` negative integers, append 0 to the `result` list.\n5. Return the `result` list.\n\nThe code uses a `SortedList` data structure to efficiently maintain the sorted order of the negative integers in the current window. The `SortedList` allows for efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of the `x`th smallest negative integer in the window. The code also handles the case where the window contains fewer than `x` negative integers by appending 0 to the `result` list.\n\nOverall, the code provides an efficient solution to the problem of finding the beauty of each subarray of size `k` in a given integer array `nums`.\n```python3\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def getSubarrayBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:\n        result = []\n        window = SortedList()\n\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] < 0:\n                window.add(nums[i])\n\n            if i >= k - 1:\n                if len(window) >= x:\n                    result.append(window[x - 1])\n                else:\n                    result.append(0)\n\n                if nums[i - k + 1] < 0:\n                    window.remove(nums[i - k + 1])\n\n        return result\n```", " To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We'll maintain a frequency counter to keep track of the count of each number in the current window. Then, for each window, we'll iterate through the frequency counter to find the xth smallest negative integer. If there are fewer than x negative integers, we'll return 0.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the beauty of each subarray.\n2. Initialize a frequency counter `freq` to keep track of the count of each number in the current window.\n3. Iterate through the array `nums`:\n   - If the current number is negative, increment its count in `freq`.\n   - If the window size is equal to `k`, calculate the beauty of the current window and append it to `result`.\n   - If the window size is greater than `k`, remove the leftmost number from the window and update `freq` accordingly.\n4. Return the `result` list.\n\nLet's implement this in code:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def getSubarrayBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:\n        result = []\n        freq = {}\n\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            # Add the current number to the frequency counter\n            if nums[i] < 0:\n                freq[nums[i]] = freq.get(nums[i], 0) + 1\n\n            # Calculate the beauty of the current window\n            if i >= k - 1:\n                count = 0\n                beauty = 0\n                for num in sorted(freq.keys()):\n                    count += freq[num]\n                    if count >= x:\n                        beauty = num\n                        break\n                result.append(beauty)\n\n            # Remove the leftmost number from the window\n            if i >= k:\n                left_num = nums[i - k]\n                if left_num < 0:\n                    freq[left_num] -= 1\n                    if freq[left_num] == 0:\n                        del freq[left_num]\n\n        return result\n```\nI have implemented the solution to the problem. The `getSubarrayBeauty` function takes three parameters: `nums`, `k`, and `x`. It returns a list containing the beauty of each subarray of size `k`.\n\nI will now run a few test cases to validate the implementation.\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\n\n# Test case 1\nnums = [1, -1, -3, -2, 3]\nk = 3\nx = 2\noutput = solution.getSubarrayBeauty(nums, k, x)\noutput\n```"], "input_token_count": 796, "output_token_counts": [806, 866, 548, 656, 668], "total_token_counts": [1602, 1662, 1344, 1452, 1464], "thinking_time": [84.0, 127.0, 88.0, 52.0, 78.0], "average_thinking_time": 83.33333333333333, "results": [true, false, false, false, false], "pass_rate": 0.2}

The code defines a `Solution` class with a single method `minReverseOperations` that takes four arguments: `n`, the length of the array; `p`, the initial position of the 1; `banned`, a list of positions that cannot have a 1; and `k`, the size of the subarray that can be reversed in one operation. The method returns a list `ans` where `ans[i]` is the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the 1 to position `i`, or `-1` if it is impossible.\n\nThe code first initializes the `ans` list with `-1` for all positions, and sets the initial position of the 1 to 0 operations. It then performs a BFS, starting from the initial position of the 1 and exploring all possible positions that the 1 can move to in the next operation. The code uses a deque `queue` to keep track of the positions to explore, and a set `banned_set` to quickly check if a position is banned.

This is because the code performs a BFS to explore all possible positions that the 1 can move to, and each position is visited at most once. The space complexity of the solution is also O(n), due to the use of the `ans`, `banned_set`, and `queue` data structures.", " To solve this problem, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the minimum number of reverse operations required to bring the 1 to each position in the array. I will start the BFS from the initial position `p` and explore all possible positions that can be reached by reversing a subarray of size `k` without violating the banned positions. I will keep track of the minimum number of reverse operations required to reach each position and return an array containing these minimum values.\n\nHere is the plan to implement the solution:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the positions that need to be explored.\n2. Initialize an array `ans` of size `n` to store the minimum number of reverse operations required to bring the 1 to each position. Initialize all values to -1, except for the initial position `p`, which is set to 0.\n3. Initialize a set `banned_set` to store the banned positions for faster lookup.\n4. Add the initial position `p` to the queue.\n5. While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a position `curr` from the queue.\n   - Calculate the left and right boundaries of the subarray that can be reversed from the current position `curr`.\n   - Iterate through all possible positions `next` within the boundaries:\n     - If `next` is not a banned position and the minimum number of reverse operations required to reach `next` is not already known, update `ans[next]` with the minimum value and add `next` to the queue.\n6. Return the `ans` array.\n\nI will now implement this solution in Python.\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minReverseOperations(self, n: int, p: int, banned: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n        # Initialize the answer array\n        ans = [-1] * n\n        ans[p] = 0\n\n        # Initialize the banned set for faster lookup\n        banned_set = set(banned)\n\n        # Initialize the queue with the initial position\n        queue = deque([p])\n\n        # Perform BFS\n        while queue:\n            curr = queue.popleft()\n\n            # Calculate the left and right boundaries of the subarray that can be reversed\n            left = max(0, curr - (k - 1) + (curr % k))\n            right = min(n - 1, curr + (k - 1) - (curr % k))\n\n            # Iterate through all possible positions within the boundaries\n            for next in range(left, right + 1, k):\n                # If the position is not banned and the minimum number of reverse operations is not already known\n                if next not in banned_set and ans[next] == -1:\n                    ans[next] = ans[curr] + 1\n                    queue.append(next)\n\n        return ans\n```\nI have implemented the solution in Python. The `minReverseOperations` function takes four parameters: `n`, `p`, `banned`, and `k`. It returns an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the 1 to position `i` in the array, or `-1` if it is impossible.\n\nI will now run a few test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\n\n# Test case 1\nn = 4\np = 0\nbanned = [1, 2]\nk = 4\nprint(solution.minReverseOperations(n, p, banned, k))\n# Expected output: [0, -1, -1, 1]\n\n# Test case 2\nn = 5\np = 0\nbanned = [2, 4]\nk = 3\nprint(solution.minReverseOperations(n, p, banned, k))\n# Expected output: [0, -1, -1, -1, -1]\n\n# Test case 3\nn = 4\np = 2\nbanned = [0, 1, 3]\nk = 1\nprint(solution.minReverseOperations(n, p, banned, k))\n# Expected output: [-1, -1, 0, -1]\n```", " To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We start by initializing a queue with the starting position `p` and a distance of 0. We also initialize a visited array to keep track of the positions that have been visited.\n\nAt each step of the BFS, we dequeue a position and its distance from the queue. We then check if the distance is less than or equal to the maximum possible distance `(n - 1) // k`. If it is, we calculate the range of positions that can be reached by reversing a subarray of size `k` from the current position. We iterate through this range and update the minimum number of reverse operations needed to reach each position if it has not been visited before.\n\nIf the distance is greater than `(n - 1) // k`, we break the loop because it is not possible to reach any further positions.\n\nFinally, we iterate through the answer array and set the positions that have not been visited to -1, indicating that it is impossible to reach them.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minReverseOperations(self, n: int, p: int, banned: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n        # Initialize the answer array with -1\n        ans = [-1] * n\n        # Initialize the visited array with False\n        visited = [False] * n\n        # Initialize the queue with the starting position and distance 0\n        queue = deque([(p, 0)])\n        # Mark the starting position as visited\n        visited[p] = True\n\n        while queue:\n            pos, dist = queue.popleft()\n            # If the distance is greater than the maximum possible distance, break the loop\n            if dist > (n - 1) // k:\n                break\n            # Calculate the range of positions that can be reached by reversing a subarray of size k from the current position\n            start = max(0, (dist + 1) * k - pos)\n            end = min(n - 1, dist * k + k - 1 - pos)\n            # Iterate through the range and update the minimum number of reverse operations needed to reach each position\n            for i in range(start, end + 1, k):\n                new_pos = pos + i\n                # If the position has not been visited before, update the answer array and mark it as visited\n                if not visited[new_pos] and new_pos not in banned:\n                    ans[new_pos] = dist + 1\n                    visited[new_pos] = True\n                    queue.append((new_pos, dist + 1))\n\n        # Set the positions that have not been visited to -1\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not visited[i] and i not in banned:\n                ans[i] = -1\n\n        return ans\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we visit each position once in the BFS. The space complexity is also O(n), which is the space required to store the answer array, visited array, and the queue.", " The following code implements a solution to find the minimum number of reverse operations required to bring the element `1` to each position in an array of length `n`, where initially the `1` is placed at position `p`. The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible positions that the `1` can move to in each step, while keeping track of the minimum number of operations required to reach each position. The code also takes into account a list of banned positions that the `1` cannot occupy.\n\nThe `minReverseOperations` function takes four arguments: `n`, `p`, `banned`, and `k`. The function initializes a list `ans` of length `n` to store the minimum number of operations required to bring the `1` to each position, and sets all values to `-1` except for the initial position `p`, which is set to `0`. The function also initializes a queue `q` to store the positions that need to be explored, and a set `b` to store the banned positions.\n\nThe function then enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration of the loop, the function dequeues a position `i` from the queue and explores all possible positions that the `1` can move to in the next step. The function calculates the left and right boundaries of the subarray that can be reversed in the next step, based on the current position `i` and the value of `k`. The function then iterates over all possible positions `j` within these boundaries, and checks if `j` is a valid position that the `1` can move to. If `j` is a valid position, the function updates the minimum number of operations required to reach `j` and adds `j` to the queue.\n\nFinally, the function returns the list `ans`, which contains the minimum number of operations required to bring the `1` to each position.\n\nHere's the full solution with comments:\n```\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minReverseOperations(self, n: int, p: int, banned: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n        # Initialize ans list to store the minimum number of operations required to bring the 1 to each position\n        ans = [-1] * n\n        ans[p] = 0\n\n        # Initialize queue to store the positions that need to be explored\n        q = deque([p])\n\n        # Initialize set to store the banned positions\n        b = set(banned)\n\n        # BFS to explore all possible positions that the 1 can move to\n        while q:\n            i = q.popleft()\n\n            # Calculate the left and right boundaries of the subarray that can be reversed in the next step\n            left = max(0, (i - k + 1) // k * k)\n            right = min(n - 1, (i + k - 1) // k * k - 1)\n\n            # Iterate over all possible positions j within the boundaries\n            for j in range(left, right + 1, k):\n                # Check if j is a valid position that the 1 can move to\n                if j not in b and ans[j] == -1:\n                    ans[j] = ans[i] + 1\n                    q.append(j)\n\n        return ans\n```\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because the code explores all possible positions that the `1` can move to using a BFS algorithm, and the number of positions that need to be explored is bounded by the length of the array.

Finally, the code returns the maximum cost substring.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumCostSubstring(self, s: str, chars: str, vals: List[int]) -> int:\n        char_values = {char: val for char, val in zip(chars, vals)}\n\n        max_cost = 0\n        current_cost = 0\n        for char in s:\n            value = char_values.get(char, ord(char) - ord('a') + 1)\n            current_cost = max(value, current_cost + value)\n            max_cost = max(max_cost, current_cost)\n\n        return max_cost\n```", " The following code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum cost substring in a given string `s`, where the cost of a substring is defined by the values of its characters. The characters' values are either predefined in the `chars` and `vals` arrays or default to their 1-indexed position in the alphabet. The algorithm iterates through the string, calculating the maximum cost substring ending at each position using a dynamic programming approach. It keeps track of the maximum cost seen so far and returns this value at the end.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumCostSubstring(self, s: str, chars: str, vals: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a dictionary to store the values of characters\n        char_values = {char: val for char, val in zip(chars, vals)}\n\n        # Initialize variables to store the maximum cost and the current cost\n        max_cost = 0\n        current_cost = 0\n\n        # Iterate through the string\n        for char in s:\n            # Get the value of the current character\n            value = char_values.get(char, ord(char) - ord('a') + 1)\n\n            # Update the current cost\n            current_cost = max(current_cost + value, value)\n\n            # Update the maximum cost\n            max_cost = max(max_cost, current_cost)\n\n        # Return the maximum cost\n        return max_cost\n```", " The following code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum cost substring in a given string `s`, where the cost of a substring is defined as the sum of the values of its characters.

If a character is not present in `chars`, its value is its position in the alphabet (1-indexed).\n\nThe algorithm works by iterating through the string `s` and maintaining an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum cost substring ending at index `i`. For each character `s[i]`, we calculate its value and update `dp[i]` as the maximum of three possibilities:\n\n1. The value of the current character `s[i]` itself.\n2.

The function returns the maximum possible sum of the values of the selected items.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def kItemsWithMaximumSum(self, numOnes: int, numZeros: int, numNegOnes: int, k: int) -> int:\n        # Select as many items with value 1 as possible\n        if k >= numOnes:\n            k -= numOnes\n            numOnes = 0\n        else:\n            numOnes -= k\n            k = 0\n\n        # Select as many items with value 0 as needed\n        if k >= numZeros:\n            k -= numZeros\n            numZeros = 0\n        else:\n            numZeros -= k\n            k = 0\n\n        # Select items with value -1 if needed\n        if k > 0:\n            numNegOnes -= k\n\n        # Calculate the sum of the selected items\n        return numOnes + numZeros * 0 + numNegOnes * -1\n```", " ```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def kItemsWithMaximumSum(self, numOnes: int, numZeros: int, numNegOnes: int, k: int) -> int:\n        if k <= numOnes:\n            return k\n        elif k <= numOnes + numZeros:\n            return numOnes\n        else:\n            return numOnes - (k - numOnes - numZeros)\n```\n\nThe solution first checks if the number of items to pick (k) is less than or equal to the number of ones.

The search space is defined between 0 and the maximum possible time, which is calculated as the time it would take for the mechanic with the lowest rank to repair all the cars. The binary search algorithm repeatedly calculates the midpoint of the search space and checks if it is possible to repair all the cars within that time frame. This is done by summing up the number of cars that each mechanic can repair within the midpoint time and comparing it to the total number of cars. If the sum is greater than or equal to the total number of cars, it means that all the cars can be repaired within the midpoint time, and the search space is updated to the left half. Otherwise, the search space is updated to the right half. The process continues until the minimum time is found.\n\nHere's the full solution with comments:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def repairCars(self, ranks: List[int], cars: int) -> int:\n        # Sort the ranks in ascending order\n        ranks.sort()\n\n        # Initialize the search space\n        left, right = 0, ranks[0] * cars * cars\n\n        # Perform binary search\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n            # Check if it is possible to repair all the cars within mid minutes\n            if sum(int((mid / rank) ** 0.5) for rank in ranks) >= cars:\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n\n        return left\n```\nTo solve this problem, the following steps are taken:\n\n1. Sort the ranks in ascending order to ensure that the mechanic with the lowest rank is considered first.\n2.

The algorithm employed is a binary search approach, which efficiently narrows down the search space for the minimum time required to repair all the cars.\n\nThe main function, `repairCars`, takes as input a list of integers `ranks` representing the ranks of the mechanics and an integer `cars` representing the total number of cars to be repaired. The function then sorts the `ranks` list in ascending order to facilitate the binary search.\n\nThe binary search is performed within a predefined range, from 0 to the square of the product of the smallest rank and the total number of cars. This range ensures that the search space includes a potential solution. Within the binary search loop, the `count` variable is used to keep track of the total number of cars that can be repaired within the current midpoint time. This count is calculated by iterating through each mechanic's rank and determining the number of cars they can repair within the midpoint time using the formula `mid // rank`.\n\nThe binary search continues to narrow down the time range until the lower and upper bounds converge. At this point, the loop terminates, and the function returns the lower bound as the minimum time required to repair all the cars.\n\nMy solution ensures that the mechanics work optimally by distributing the cars among them in such a way that the total repair time is minimized. This is achieved through the binary search approach, which systematically explores the time range to find the minimum possible value.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def repairCars(self, ranks: List[int], cars: int) -> int:\n        ranks.sort()\n        l, r = 0, ranks[0] * cars * cars\n        while l < r:\n            mid = (l + r) // 2\n            count = sum(int((mid // rank) ** 0.5) for rank in ranks)\n            if count >= cars:\n                r = mid\n            else:\n                l = mid + 1\n        return l\n```", " To solve this problem, we can use binary search to find the minimum time required to repair all the cars.\n\nThe minimum time required is 0, and the maximum time required is the time taken by the mechanic with the lowest rank to repair all the cars.\n\nWe can calculate the number of cars that can be repaired in a given time by iterating through the ranks of all the mechanics and summing up the number of cars each mechanic can repair in that time.\n\nWe can then compare the number of cars that can be repaired in the given time with the total number of cars. If the number of cars that can be repaired is less than the total number of cars, we need to increase the time. Otherwise, we can decrease the time.\n\nWe continue this process until we find the minimum time required to repair all the cars.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass Solution:\n    def repairCars(self, ranks: List[int], cars: int) -> int:\n        left = 0\n        right = min(ranks) * cars * cars\n\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            count = sum(math.isqrt(mid // rank) for rank in ranks)\n\n            if count >= cars:\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n\n        return left\n```\n\nIn the above code, `left` and `right` represent the minimum and maximum time required to repair all the cars. `mid` represents the current time being considered. `count` represents the number of cars that can be repaired in `mid` time.\n\nWe use `math.isqrt(mid // rank)` to calculate the number of cars that can be repaired by a mechanic with rank `rank` in `mid` time. This is because the time required to repair `n` cars is `rank * n * n`.\n\nWe continue the binary search until `left` and `right` converge to the minimum time required to repair all the cars.", " To solve this problem, we can use binary search to find the minimum time required to repair all the cars.\n\nThe idea is to set the left boundary as 0 and the right boundary as the maximum possible time required to repair all the cars by the mechanic with the lowest rank. Then, we calculate the mid time and check if it is possible to repair all the cars within this time.\n\nTo check if it is possible, we iterate through each mechanic and calculate the number of cars they can repair within the mid time. If the total number of cars repaired by all the mechanics is greater than or equal to the total number of cars, it means it is possible to repair all the cars within the mid time. In this case, we update the right boundary to mid - 1. Otherwise, we update the left boundary to mid + 1.\n\nWe continue this process until the left boundary is greater than the right boundary. At this point, the minimum time required to repair all the cars is left boundary.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass Solution:\n    def repairCars(self, ranks: List[int], cars: int) -> int:\n        left = 0\n        right = min(ranks) * cars * cars\n\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            total_cars = 0\n\n            for rank in ranks:\n                total_cars += int(math.sqrt(mid / rank))\n\n            if total_cars >= cars:\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n\n        return left\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log m), where n is the number of mechanics and m is the maximum possible time required to repair all the cars by the mechanic with the lowest rank.

We will keep track of the minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findMinimumTime(self, tasks: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Sort tasks based on end times\n        tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n        # Initialize time intervals as an empty list\n        intervals = []\n\n        # Iterate through sorted tasks\n        for task in tasks:\n            start, end, duration = task\n\n            # Check if there is enough time to complete the task\n            while duration > 0:\n                # Find the latest time interval that ends before or at the start time of the task\n                latest_interval = next((interval for interval in reversed(intervals) if interval[1] <= start), None)\n\n                # If there is no such interval, create a new one\n                if latest_interval is None:\n                    intervals.append([start, start])\n                    latest_interval = intervals[-1]\n\n                # Calculate the available time in the latest interval\n                available_time = min(end, latest_interval[1]) - latest_interval[0] + 1\n\n                # Update the duration and the latest interval\n                duration -= available_time\n                latest_interval[1] += available_time\n\n                # If the duration is still greater than 0, remove the latest interval\n                if duration > 0:\n                    intervals.remove(latest_interval)\n\n        # Return the total time occupied by all intervals\n        return sum(interval[1] - interval[0] + 1 for interval in intervals)\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of tasks. This is because for each task, we may need to iterate through all the previous intervals to find the latest interval that ends before or at the start time of the task. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of tasks, as we need to store all the intervals.", " To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will sort the tasks based on their end times in ascending order. Then, we will iterate through the sorted tasks and keep track of the time intervals that are already occupied. For each task, we will check if there is enough time to complete it within its given time range. If there is, we will mark the time intervals as occupied and continue to the next task. If there is not enough time, we will need to turn on the computer for additional time to complete the task. We will keep track of the minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n\nHere is the plan to implement this solution:\n1. Sort the tasks based on their end times in ascending order.\n2. Initialize an array `occupied` of size 2001 (maximum possible end time) to keep track of the time intervals that are already occupied.\n3. Initialize a variable `time` to keep track of the minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n4. Iterate through the sorted tasks:\n   - For each task, iterate from its start time to its end time:\n     - If the current time interval is not occupied, mark it as occupied and decrement the duration of the task.\n     - If the duration of the task becomes 0, break the inner loop.\n   - If the duration of the task is still greater than 0, it means that there is not enough time to complete the task within its given time range. In this case, we need to turn on the computer for additional time.\n     - Iterate from the end time to the start time in reverse order:\n       - If the current time interval is not occupied, mark it as occupied and decrement the duration of the task.\n       - Increment the `time` variable by 1 for each time interval that is marked as occupied.\n5.

This is because each set bit in `n` requires one operation to be unset (i.e., reduced to 0).\n\nThe code defines a function `minOperations` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to 0. The function first checks if `n` is 0, in which case it returns 0.

In each iteration of the loop, it checks if the least significant bit of `n` is set. If it is, it increments `count` by 1.

It uses a priority queue to keep track of the characters that can be placed at each position, ensuring that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest. The code also handles the case where no such string exists by checking for inconsistencies in the LCP matrix. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:\n\n1. The function initializes a priority queue to store tuples of the form `(-lcp[i][i], i)`, where the negative sign is used to simulate the max heap behavior. This allows us to prioritize characters with higher LCP values.\n2. It then iterates through the positions in the string, starting from the first position.\n3. For each position, the code checks if the current LCP value is 0. If it is, it means that the current character cannot be the same as the previous character, so it appends the smallest possible character ('a') to the result string and moves on to the next position.\n4. If the current LCP value is not 0, the code checks if the priority queue is empty or if the LCP value of the top character in the queue is less than the current LCP value. If either condition is true, it means that there is no valid string that corresponds to the LCP matrix, so the function returns an empty string.\n5. If the priority queue contains a valid character, the code appends it to the result string and updates the LCP values for the next position.\n6. The function continues this process until it has constructed the entire string.\n\nThe code then returns the resulting string. If the string is empty, it means that no valid string exists, and the function returns an empty string.\n```python3\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findTheString(self, lcp: List[List[int]]) -> str:\n        n = len(lcp)\n        res = []\n        pq = []\n\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            heappush(pq, (-lcp[i][i], i))\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            if lcp[i][i] == 0:\n                if res and res[-1] == 'a':\n                    return \"\"\n                res.append('a')\n            else:\n                if not pq or -pq[0][0] < lcp[i][i]:\n                    return \"\"\n                _, idx = heappop(pq)\n                if res and res[-1] >= chr(ord('a') + idx):\n                    return \"\"\n                res.append(chr(ord('a') + idx))\n                for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                    lcp[j][idx] -= 1\n\n        return \"\".join(res)\n```", " The following code snippet is designed to solve the problem of reconstructing a lexicographically smallest string from a given LCP (Longest Common Prefix) matrix.

To solve this problem, I use a two-pointer technique.\n\nFirst, I sort the input array `nums` in non-decreasing order. This sorting step is crucial because it allows us to leverage the properties of the sorted array to optimize our search for fair pairs.\n\nNext, I initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the start and end of the array, respectively.

Convert the gifts list into a max heap, where the negative values of the gifts are stored. This is done to utilize Python's built-in min heap and transform it into a max heap.\n2. Perform the gift picking process `k` times.\n3. In each iteration, remove the pile with the maximum number of gifts from the heap.\n4. Calculate the number of gifts to leave behind by taking the integer square root of the maximum number of gifts.\n5. Add the remaining gifts back to the heap.\n6. After the `k` iterations, calculate the total number of gifts remaining by summing up the negative values in the heap.\n7. Return the total number of gifts remaining.", " The following code implements a solution to the problem of distributing gifts from piles, where in each second, the pile with the maximum number of gifts is chosen, and the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile is left behind, while the rest are taken. The process is repeated `k` times, and the code is designed to return the total number of gifts remaining after `k` seconds.\n\nMy solution uses a max heap to efficiently keep track of the pile with the maximum number of gifts. The heap is initialized with the negated values of the gifts to simulate a max heap using Python's heapq module, which only provides a min heap. The code then enters a loop that runs `k` times, where in each iteration, the pile with the maximum number of gifts is popped from the heap, the square root of its size is calculated, and the remaining gifts are pushed back into the heap. Finally, the code calculates and returns the sum of the remaining gifts in the heap.\n```python3\nimport heapq\nimport math\n\nclass Solution:\n    def pickGifts(self, gifts: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Convert gifts to a max heap\n        gifts = [-g for g in gifts]\n        heapq.heapify(gifts)\n\n        # Pop the pile with the maximum number of gifts,\n        # leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts,\n        # and push the remaining gifts back into the heap\n        for _ in range(k):\n            max_gifts = -heapq.heappop(gifts)\n            remaining_gifts = math.isqrt(max_gifts)\n            heapq.heappush(gifts, -remaining_gifts)\n\n        # Return the total number of gifts remaining in the heap\n        return -sum(gifts)\n```"], "input_token_count": 500, "output_token_counts": [529, 392, 348, 516, 415], "total_token_counts": [1029, 892, 848, 1016, 915], "thinking_time": [51.0, 39.0, 43.0, 40.0, 29.0], "average_thinking_time": 40.666666666666664, "results": [false, true, true, true, true], "pass_rate": 0.8}

The first element of `count` is set to 1 if the first word in `words` is a vowel string, and 0 otherwise.

The code is written in Python and follows the provided function signature, making it compatible with the problem's constraints and requirements.\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def alternateDigitSum(self, n: int) -> int:\n        # Convert the number to a string to easily iterate through its digits\n        digits = str(n)\n        # Initialize the result to 0\n        result = 0\n        # Iterate through each digit in the number\n        for i in range(len(digits)):\n            # Convert the digit back to an integer\n            digit = int(digits[i])\n            # If the digit's index is even, add the digit to the result\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                result += digit\n            # If the digit's index is odd, subtract the digit from the result\n            else:\n                result -= digit\n        # Return the final result\n        return result\n```", " ```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def alternateDigitSum(self, n: int) -> int:\n        digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]\n        return sum((-1) ** i * digits[i] for i in range(len(digits)))\n```\n\nThe solution first converts the integer `n` into a list of its digits. Then, it calculates the alternating sum by iterating through the digits and multiplying each digit by `(-1) ** i`, where `i` is the index of the digit. This ensures that the sign of each digit alternates as required. Finally, it returns the sum of these values.", " To solve this problem, we can convert the given integer `n` to a string and then iterate through each digit. We will keep track of the current sign (positive or negative) and add or subtract the digit from the total sum based on the current sign.
