Therefore, we should try to reduce the maximum value as much as possible.\n\nHere's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python3\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumArrayLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Sort the array to easily access the largest values\n        nums.sort()\n        \n        # If the array has only one element, return 1\n        if len(nums) == 1:\n            return 1\n        \n        # If the second largest value is 1, the minimum length is 1\n        if nums[-2] == 1:\n            return 1\n        \n        # Otherwise, the minimum length is the count of numbers greater than 1\n        return len([num for num in nums if num > 1])\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array helps us easily identify the largest and second largest values.\n\n2. **Check for Single Element**: If the array has only one element, returning 1 ensures that the length is minimized.\n\n3. **Check for Maximum Value 1**: If the second largest value is 1, the minimum length is 1 because the largest value can be reduced to 0 through repeated operations.\n\n4. **Count Numbers Greater Than 1**: For all other cases, we count the number of elements greater than 1, which gives us the minimum length required to reduce the array to its smallest possible form.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum length of the array using the given operations. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the array. The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) since we are not using any additional space proportional to the input size.", "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the length of the array by repeatedly applying the given operation. The key observation here is that if two numbers in the array have a common divisor greater than 1, we can always divide them by their greatest common divisor (GCD) until they become 1. This will reduce the length of the array.\n\nHere's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import *\nfrom collections import *\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumArrayLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Calculate the GCD of all elements in the array\n        gcd_val = nums[0]\n        for num in nums[1:]:\n            gcd_val = math.gcd(gcd_val, num)\n        \n        # If the GCD is 1, return 1\n        if gcd_val == 1:\n            return 1\n        \n        # Otherwise, calculate the number of times we need to divide the GCD by 2\n        count = 0\n        while gcd_val % 2 == 0:\n            gcd_val //= 2\n            count += 1\n        \n        # Return the minimum length of the array after performing the operation\n        return count + 1\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. We first calculate the GCD of all elements in the array using the `math.gcd` function. If the GCD is 1, we return 1 because no further reduction is possible.\n\n2. If the GCD is not 1, we then count how many times we need to divide the GCD by 2. This is done by iterating through the GCD value and dividing it by 2 until it becomes odd.\n\n3. Finally, we return the minimum length of the array after performing the operation. This is calculated as the count of divisions plus one, since we need at least one more division to ensure the GCD is reduced to 1.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum length of the array by leveraging the properties of the GCD.", "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the length of the array `nums` by repeatedly applying the specified operations. The key insight is to use the properties of modulo arithmetic to simplify the process.\n\nHere's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumArrayLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Sort the array in descending order\n        nums.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        # Initialize the count of numbers greater than 1\n        cnt = sum(1 for num in nums if num > 1)\n        \n        # If there are no numbers greater than 1, return 1\n        if cnt == 0:\n            return 1\n        \n        # If there is only one number greater than 1, return 1\n        elif cnt == 1:\n            return 1\n        \n        # Otherwise, the minimum length is 2\n        else:\n            return 2\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: First, we sort the array in descending order. This helps us always work with the largest possible values first.\n\n2. **Count Numbers Greater Than 1**: We iterate through the sorted array and count how many numbers are greater than 1. This step determines the number of elements that can be used in the operations.\n\n3. **Handle Special Cases**:\n   - If there are no numbers greater than 1 (`cnt == 0`), the minimum length is 1.\n   - If there is only one number greater than 1 (`cnt == 1`), the minimum length is also 1.\n   - For more than one number greater than 1, the minimum length is 2 because each operation reduces the array size by at least 2.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum length of the array using the given operations.", "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the length of the array `nums` by repeatedly applying the given operation. The operation involves selecting two distinct indices `i` and `j` with `nums[i] > 0` and `nums[j] > 0`, inserting `nums[i] % nums[j]` at the end of `nums`, and deleting the elements at indices `i` and `j`.\n\nHere's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumArrayLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Sort the array in descending order\n        nums.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        # Iterate through the sorted array starting from the second element\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            # If the current element is not equal to the previous one,\n            # it means there are still numbers greater than the current one\n            if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:\n                break\n        \n        # Return the count of unique numbers remaining after the loop\n        return len(set(nums[:i]))\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: We start by sorting the array in descending order. This allows us to focus on the largest numbers first.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Sorted Array**: We iterate through the sorted array starting from the second element (index 1).\n\n3. **Check for Unique Numbers**: For each element, we check if it is different from the previous one. If they are different, it means there are still numbers greater than the current one. In this case, we stop iterating.\n\n4. **Count Unique Numbers**: After the loop, we return the count of unique numbers remaining in the array up to the point where we stopped iterating.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum possible length of the array by leveraging the properties of the sorted array and the given operation.

The key insight is that the smallest possible value in the array will always be used to perform the operations. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Smallest Value**: Find the smallest element in the array. This is because using the smallest element ensures that the maximum possible remainder when divided by any other element is minimized.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences of the Smallest Element**: Count how many times the smallest element appears in the array. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest element, we need to ensure that the smallest element is not deleted completely.\n\n3. **Calculate the Minimum Length**: The minimum length of the array after performing the operations is determined by the count of the smallest element.

We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the start and end of the current window, respectively.\n3. We iterate through the array using the `right` pointer.\n4. For each element at index `right`, we increment its frequency in the `freq` dictionary.\n5. If the frequency of the current element exceeds `k`, we move the `left` pointer to the right until the frequency of the current element is less than or equal to `k`.\n6. We update the `max_length` variable whenever we find a valid subarray (i.e., the frequency of all elements in the current window is less than or equal to `k`).\n7. Finally, we return the `max_length` as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid subarray with at most `k` frequency using a sliding window technique.

If the current child is infected (`i == sick[j]`), then the current child cannot infect any other child, so `dp[i][j] = 0`. Otherwise, we can either choose to infect the current child or not, leading to two choices:\n   - Choose to infect the current child (`dp[i - 1][j - 1]`)\n   - Do not infect the current child (`dp[i - 1][j + 1]`)\n   \n4. **Modulo Operation**: After calculating the number of ways, we take the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers.\n\n5. **Summing Up**: Finally, we sum up all possible infection sequences for \\( n \\) children.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of valid infection sequences using dynamic programming.", "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of possible infection sequences for \\( n \\) children where some children are initially infected.

Initially, the starting positions are marked as 1 because only one child is initially infected.\n\n2. **Update Infection Sequences**: We iterate through the `sick` positions and update the `dp` list. For each sick position \\( i \\), the number of ways to infect \\( i \\) is the sum of the ways to infect its two neighbors (`i-1` and `i+1`). This is because the child at position \\( i \\) can spread the disease to both its neighbors if they exist and are not infected.\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Positions**: After updating the infection sequences for the `sick` positions, we iterate through the remaining positions (positions not in `sick`) and calculate the number of ways to infect each position. The number of ways to infect the current position is the sum of the ways to infect its neighbors.\n\n4. **Result**: Finally, the result is the product of the number of ways to infect each position, which gives us the total number of possible infection sequences.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly count the number of possible infection sequences while considering the constraints and properties of the problem.", "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of possible infection sequences for a given number of children `n` and a list of infected positions `sick`.

Iterate through each character in the string `s`.\n\n3. For each character, update the `vowel_count` based on whether it is a vowel or a consonant. If it is a vowel, increment `vowel_count`; otherwise, decrement it.\n\n4. Check if the current `vowel_count` is equal to half the length of the string (`len(s) // 2`). This ensures that the number of vowels and consonants is balanced.\n\n5. Calculate the product of the current `vowel_count` and the remaining consonants in the substring. If the product is divisible by `k`, increment the `result` counter.\n\n6. Return the final `result` count of beautiful substrings.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all beautiful substrings with the required properties.

There are `limit + 1` choices for which child gets more than `limit`, and the remaining two children must get 0 candies. So, there are \\( (limit + 1) \\times 1^2 \\times 1^2 = (limit + 1) \\) invalid distributions.\n   \n   - **Two Children Get More Than `limit`:**\n     If two children get more than `limit` candies, the third child must get exactly 0 candies.

The recurrence relation will be:\n     \\[\n     dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-limit][j]\n     \\]\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Initialize a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (limit+1)` and set all values to 0.\n   - Fill the dp table using the recurrence relation.\n   - The final result will be `dp[n][limit]`.\n\nHere's the Python implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:\n        if n > 3 * limit:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Initialize the dp table\n        dp = [[0 for _ in range(limit + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        \n        # Base cases\n        dp[0][0] = 1\n        \n        # Fill the dp table\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            for j in range(limit + 1):\n                if j == 0:\n                    dp[i][j] = 0\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[max(i-limit, 0)][j]\n        \n        # Return the result\n        return dp[n][limit]\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1.

Finally, we construct the result matrix by iterating through each cell of the grid and calculating the product of the corresponding prefix and suffix products modulo 12345.\n\nThis approach ensures that we only need to traverse the grid once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n * m), where n and m are the dimensions of the grid. The space complexity is also O(n * m) due to the additional arrays used for storing the prefix and suffix products.", "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the product of each element in the grid except for the current element itself.

We initialize two arrays `pre` and `suf` with the same length as the grid plus one. The `pre` array stores the prefix products, and the `suf` array stores the suffix products.\n\n2. We iterate through the grid to fill the `pre` array. For each element at position `(i, j)`, we calculate the prefix product up to that element by multiplying the previous prefix product by the current element.\n\n3. Similarly, we iterate through the grid again to fill the `suf` array. For each element at position `(i, j)`, we calculate the suffix product from that element to the end of the row by multiplying the next suffix product by the current element.\n\n4. Finally, we construct the result matrix by iterating through the grid and calculating the product of the corresponding elements in the `pre` and `suf` arrays.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the product matrix while adhering to the constraints and example cases provided.", "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the product of all elements in each row and column of the given matrix, excluding the current element itself.

The idea is to find the maximum number of alloys that can be created given a certain budget. We start by setting the left boundary of our search as 0 (since no alloy can be created) and the right boundary as the maximum possible number of alloys that can be created. We then perform a binary search on this range, checking if it's possible to create the desired number of alloys with the given budget. If it is, we move the left boundary up; otherwise, we move the right boundary down.

The base case `dp[0][0] = 1` means there is one way to transform an empty string into an empty string.\n\n2. **DP Table Filling**: We iterate through each character of both strings `s` and `t`.

For each digit, we check if it forms a valid pair with the next digit (`i + 2`). If it does, we return the current count of deletions `dels`.\n4. If no valid pair is found after iterating through the entire number, we return the total length of the number, indicating that all digits must be deleted.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimum number of deletions required to make the number special efficiently.

This is done by dividing `k` by the length of the `receiver` array and rounding up to ensure that we cover all possible passes.\n\n2. **Initialize Variables**: Initialize `max_sum` to store the maximum sum found so far and `current_player` to store the current player.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Each Player**: Iterate through each player in the `receiver` array.\n   - For each player, calculate the sum of the current player and their neighbors using the formula `current_sum = current_player + receiver[current_player]`.\n   - Update `max_sum` if the current sum is greater than the previous maximum sum.\n   - Move to the next player based on the current player's position using the formula `(current_player + total_passes) % len(receiver)`.\n\n4. **Return Result**: Return the maximum sum found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we simulate the ball passing process for each possible starting player and keep track of the maximum sum encountered, which gives us the desired result.

This helps us quickly compute the sum of the path taken by the ball after \\( k \\) passes.\n\n2. **Finding the Maximum Player**: We iterate through each player and calculate the sum of the path taken by the ball after \\( k \\) passes using the cumulative sum. We keep track of the maximum value encountered and the corresponding player.\n\n3. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the maximum value found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.", "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the ball passing game and calculate the sum of the sender's id and the ids of all players who receive the ball during each pass.

A k-avoiding array means that no two distinct elements in the array sum up to \\( k \\).\n\nHere's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumSum(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize the sum to zero\n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through the first half of the numbers from 1 to k//2\n        for i in range(1, k // 2 + 1):\n            # Add both i and k-i to the sum\n            total_sum += i + (k - i)\n        \n        # If n is odd, add the middle number (k//2) once to ensure the sum is minimized\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            total_sum += k // 2\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing the `total_sum` to zero.\n2. **Iterate Through the First Half**: We iterate through the first half of the numbers from 1 to \\( k // 2 \\). For each number \\( i \\), we add both \\( i \\) and \\( k - i \\) to the `total_sum`. This ensures that we cover all possible pairs of distinct elements that sum to \\( k \\).\n3. **Handle Odd Length**: If \\( n \\) is odd, we add the middle number \\( k // 2 \\) once to ensure that the sum is minimized. This is because adding the middle number will help us form more pairs of distinct elements that sum to \\( k \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we get the minimum possible sum while satisfying the condition that no two distinct elements sum to \\( k \\).

We initialize a DP table `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (x+1)` where `n` is the length of `nums1`.\n\n2. The base case `dp[0][0]` is set to 0 because no operations are needed if there are no elements in `nums1`.\n\n3. We iterate through each element in `nums1` and each possible sum up to `x` in the DP table.\n\n4. For each element, we consider two cases:\n   - **Do nothing**: In this case, the time required remains the same as the previous state.\n   - **Apply the operation**: If the current sum is at least `nums2[i-1]`, we can apply the operation, reducing the sum by `nums2[i-1]` and adding `nums1[i-1]` back. This reduces the time required by 1.\n\n5. We update the DP table with the minimum time required for each state.\n\n6. Finally, we check if the minimum time required to make the sum of `nums1` <= `x` is still infinity. If it is, it means it's impossible to achieve the desired sum, and we return -1.

Use a while loop to expand the window from the left to the right:\n   - Increment the frequency of the current element at the right pointer.\n   - If the frequency of the current element becomes 1, increment `unique_count`.\n   - While `unique_count` exceeds the number of distinct elements in the entire array (`len(freq)`), shrink the window from the left by decrementing the frequency of the element at the left pointer and adjusting `unique_count` accordingly.\n   - Calculate the number of valid subarrays ending at the current right index using the formula `(right - left + 1) * (right - left) // 2`.\n   - Add the total number of valid subarrays to the result.\n   - Move the right pointer to the next position.\n\n3.

This helps in avoiding redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function takes two parameters: `i`, which represents the current position in the string, and `prev`, which represents the previous digit. It returns the number of stepping numbers ending at the current position `i`.\n\n   - If `i` equals the length of `high_list`, it means we have reached the end of the string, so we return 1.\n   - If `i` is greater than 0 and the absolute difference between the current digit and the previous digit is not 1, we return 0.\n   - Otherwise, we iterate through all possible digits (0 to 9) and recursively call `dp` for the next position, considering whether the current digit can be used or not based on the previous digit.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Count**: We calculate the number of stepping numbers starting from 0 up to `high-1` by calling `dp(0, 0) - dp(0, low_list[0])` and taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the stepping numbers within the given range while handling edge cases like leading zeros.", "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of stepping numbers within a given range `[low, high]`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), and the space complexity is also O(1).\n\nLet's verify the correctness of this solution with the provided examples:\n\n### Example 1\n- Input: `num = 4`, `t = 1`\n- Output: `6`\n- Explanation: \n  - Apply the operation once to `x`: `x = 4 + 1 = 5`\n  - Apply the operation once to `num`: `num = 4 + 1 = 5`\n  - Total increase: `2 * 1 = 2`\n  - Final result: `4 + 2 = 6`\n\n### Example 2\n- Input: `num = 3`, `t = 2`\n- Output: `7`\n- Explanation: \n  - Apply the operation once to `x`: `x = 3 + 1 = 4`\n  - Apply the operation once to `num`: `num = 3 + 1 = 4`\n  - Apply the operation once to `x`: `x = 4 + 1 = 5`\n  - Apply the operation once to `num`: `num = 4 + 1 = 5`\n  - Total increase: `2 * 2 = 4`\n  - Final result: `3 + 4 = 7`\n\nBoth examples demonstrate that the function correctly calculates the maximum achievable number based on the given constraints.", "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum achievable number after applying the given operation no more than `t` times. The operation consists of increasing or decreasing both `x` and `num` by 1 simultaneously.\n\nHere's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def theMaximumAchievableX(self, num: int, t: int) -> int:\n        # Calculate the maximum achievable number\n        return num + 2 * t\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1.

This is because each operation increases both `x` and `num` by 1, so we need to perform this operation `t` times to achieve the maximum possible difference between `x` and `num`.\n\n2. The result is then returned as the maximum achievable number.\n\nLet's break down why this works:\n\n- If we start with `num` and apply the operation `t` times, the net effect on `num` is `t`.\n- For each operation, `x` increases by 1 and `num` decreases by 1. Therefore, the net effect on `x` is `-t`.\n- To maximize `x`, we need to increase `x` by the maximum amount possible, which is `t`.\n- Thus, the maximum achievable number is `num + t`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the maximum possible achievable number within the given constraints.", "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum achievable number based on the given constraints.

We start with the given number `num`.\n2. We calculate the maximum achievable number by adding `2 * t` to `num`. This is because each operation (increase or decrease by 1) effectively doubles the difference between `num` and the achieved number.\n3.

We initialize a variable `res` to 1, which will store the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray found so far.\n\n2. We iterate through the arrays using a loop from index 1 to `len(nums1) - 1`.\n\n3. For each element, we compare it with the previous element in `nums1`:\n   - If `nums1[i]` is greater than or equal to `nums1[i-1]`, we update `res` by adding 1 to the previous value of `res`.\n   - If `nums1[i]` is not greater than or equal to `nums1[i-1]`, we then check if `nums1[i]` is greater than or equal to `nums2[i-1]`.\n     - If true, we update `res` by adding 1 to the previous value of `res`.\n     - If false, we reset `res` to 1 because starting a new subarray from `nums1[i]` would be better.\n\n4.

The base case of the recursion is when both `i` and `j` reach the end of their respective arrays (`i >= len(nums1)` and `j >= len(nums2)`).

The time complexity is O(log(60)), which is feasible given the constraints.", "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of operations required to make `num1` equal to 0 by subtracting `2i + num2` from `num1`. The key insight here is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum number of operations needed for each possible value of `num1`.\n\nHere's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def makeTheIntegerZero(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize the DP table with infinity values except for dp[0]\n        dp = [float('inf')] * (num1 + 1)\n        dp[0] = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through all possible values of num1\n        for i in range(1, num1 + 1):\n            # Calculate the maximum value that can be achieved by subtracting 2i + num2\n            max_value = min(i // num2, i)\n            \n            # Update the DP table for each possible value of num1\n            for j in range(max_value, 0, -1):\n                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j * num2] + j)\n        \n        # Return the result if it is within the valid range, otherwise return -1\n        return dp[num1] if dp[num1] != float('inf') else -1\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a DP table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations needed to make `i` equal to 0. We set `dp[0]` to 0 because no operations are needed to make 0 equal to 0.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Iteration**: We iterate through all possible values of `num1` from 1 to `num1`. For each value of `i`, we calculate the maximum value that can be achieved by subtracting `2i + num2`. This maximum value helps us determine the range of possible values for `j` that we need to consider.\n\n3. **Update DP Table**: For each possible value of `j`, we update the DP table for `i` using the formula `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j * num2] + j)`. This ensures that we consider all possible ways to reach `i` by subtracting multiples of `num2` plus some constant.\n\n4. **Result**: After iterating through all possible values of `num1`, we check if `dp[num1]` is still infinity. If it is, it means that it is not possible to make `num1` equal to 0, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return `dp[num1]`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of operations required to make `num1` equal to 0 using dynamic programming.", "To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming.

We also update `max_val` to ensure we only consider sums greater than or equal to `max_val`.\n   - If the current sum is less than `max_val`, we break out of the loop as we have already found the maximum possible sum for the remaining queries.\n4. **Returning Results**: Finally, we return the maximum sums for the valid queries using the `max_indices`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum sums for each query while maintaining the correct order of the results.", "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

If there are such queries, we update their results to `-1` because they cannot satisfy the conditions.\n6. We then push the current query onto the stack and calculate the maximum sum of `nums1` and `nums2` at the current index.\n7. Finally, we append the calculated maximum sum to the result list `ans`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum sum for each query using a stack data structure.

We handle the base case where the string is empty, as no inversion is needed.\n\n3. We fill the DP array iteratively:\n   - For each character in the string, we check if it is '0' or '1'.\n   - If the character is '0', we update `dp[i][0]` as the minimum of the current `dp[i-1][0]` and `dp[i-1][1]` plus `(i + 1)` (cost of inversion).\n   - If the character is '1', we update `dp[i][1]` as the minimum of the current `dp[i-1][0]` and `dp[i-1][1]` plus `(n - i)` (cost of inversion).\n\n4. Finally, we return the minimum value between `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-1][1]`, which represents the minimum cost to make the entire string equal to either '0' or '1'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum cost using dynamic programming.", "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost to make all characters in the string equal using the two types of operations described.

Initialize variables to keep track of the total cost (`cost`), the count of zeros (`zero_count`), and the count of ones (`one_count`).\n\n2. Iterate through each character in the string `s`.\n\n   - If the character is '0', increment the `zero_count`.\n   - If the character is '1', increment the `one_count`.\n\n3.

Initialize two sets: `seen` to keep track of friends who have received the ball, and `friends` to keep track of all friends.\n2. Set the initial position to 1 and the step count to 1.\n3. Use a while loop to iterate through the friends in a circular manner:\n   - Calculate the next position using the formula `(current_position + step_count * k) % n + 1`.\n   - If the next position is already in the `seen` set, it means we have found a cycle, so break out of the loop.\n   - Otherwise, add the next position to the `seen` set.\n   - Update the current position and increment the step count.\n4.

If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, we wrap around using modulo operation.\n\n3. We continue moving the `hare` pointer forward until it meets the `tortoise` pointer. At this point, the `tortoise` pointer will be at the starting position of the cycle, which is also the starting position of the losing friend.\n\n4. We reset the `tortoise` pointer to the start of the list and move both pointers forward until they meet again. This ensures that we have found all nodes visited by the `tortoise` pointer.\n\n5. We collect all nodes visited by the `tortoise` pointer and return them as the list of losers.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it suitable for the given constraints.", "To solve this problem, we can use a set to keep track of the friends who have received the ball.

We initialize a set `friends` to store the friends who have received the ball. We start with the first friend (number 1).\n\n2. We enter a loop where we calculate the next friend based on the given rule: `next_friend = (current_friend + k - 1) % n + 1`. This ensures that the friend wraps around the circle correctly.\n\n3. If the next friend has already received the ball (i.e., it is in the set), we break out of the loop because no new friend will receive the ball again.\n\n4. Otherwise, we add the next friend to the set and move to the next friend.\n\n5.

If it is, there cannot be a valid `original` array because the number of elements would be odd, which contradicts the requirement that `derived` has an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n\n2. **Initialize Original Array**: We initialize the first element of `original` to 0. This is because the bitwise XOR operation with any value will not change the value of the original element unless the other operand is 1.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Derived Array**: We iterate through the `derived` array. For each element at index `i`, we update the corresponding element in `original` using the formula `original[i] = original[i - 1] ^ derived[i]`. This step effectively builds the `original` array from the derived array.\n\n4. **Check Last Element**: After iterating through the entire `derived` array, we check if the last element of `original` matches the last element of `derived`. If they do not match, it means there is no valid `original` array that produces the given `derived` array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly determine if a valid `original` array exists based on the given `derived` array.", "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a binary array `original` that, when bitwise XORed with its adjacent elements, results in the given `derived` array. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to check if there exists a sequence of binary numbers (0s and 1s) such that their pairwise XOR results in the given `derived` array.\n\n2. **Observation**: Notice that if we start with a single element, the next element will be the result of XORing the first element with the second element. This pattern continues until the last element, which is the result of XORing the second last element with the first element.\n\n3. **Formulate the Solution**:\n   - If the length of `derived` is odd, it's impossible to form a valid `original` because the last element would be different from the first element due to the XOR operation.\n   - If the length of `derived` is even, we can check if the sequence can be formed by starting with a single element and ensuring that the XOR operations maintain the correct parity.\n\n4. **Check Parity**:\n   - For an even-length `derived` array, the XOR operation maintains the same parity as the original array. Therefore, we need to ensure that the parity of the first element matches the parity of the last element in the `derived` array.\n\nHere's the Python implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def doesValidArrayExist(self, derived: List[int]) -> bool:\n        # Check if the length of derived is odd\n        if len(derived) % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # Determine the parity of the first element based on the last element\n        if derived[-1] == 1:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. **Check Length**: If the length of `derived` is odd, it's impossible to form a valid `original` because the last element would be different from the first element due to the XOR operation.\n2. **Determine Parity**: If the last element of `derived` is 1, the first element must also be 1 to maintain the same parity. If the last element is 0, the first element can be either 0 or 1, but it must be consistent with the parity requirement.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly determine if a valid `original` array exists based on the given `derived` array.", "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a valid binary array `original` that could produce the given `derived` array using the bitwise XOR operation. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to check if the `derived` array can be reconstructed from the first element of the `original` array using the bitwise XOR operation. Specifically, `derived[i] = original[i] ^ original[i+1]`.\n\n2. **Analyze the Derived Array**: Since the `derived` array contains only 0s and 1s, we can use the property of XOR that `x ^ x = 0` and `x ^ 0 = x`. This means that if we start with any value for `original[0]`, we can reconstruct the entire `original` array by applying the XOR operation iteratively.\n\n3. **Check the Parity**: The key observation here is that the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of 1s in the `derived` array must match the parity of the number of 1s in the `original` array. This is because each pair of consecutive elements in the `original` array contributes exactly one bit to the `derived` array (either 0 or 1).\n\n4. **Implement the Solution**: We can iterate through the `derived` array and count the number of 1s. Then, we compare this count with the parity of the length of the `derived` array. If they match, it means there exists a valid `original` array; otherwise, it does not.\n\nHere's the Python implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def doesValidArrayExist(self, derived: List[int]) -> bool:\n        # Count the number of 1s in the derived array\n        num_ones = sum(derived)\n        \n        # Check if the number of 1s matches the parity of the length of the derived array\n        return num_ones % 2 == len(derived) % 2\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n- We count the number of 1s in the `derived` array.\n- We check if this count is even if the length of the `derived` array is even, or odd if the length of the `derived` array is odd.\n- If both conditions are satisfied, it means there exists a valid `original` array; otherwise, it does not.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly determine if a valid `original` array exists based on the given `derived` array.", "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a valid binary array `original` that could have produced the given `derived` array through bitwise XOR operations. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to check if there exists a binary array where the bitwise XOR of consecutive elements matches the corresponding element in the derived array.\n\n2. **Observation**: Notice that the XOR operation is both associative and commutative. This means that the order of operations does not matter. Therefore, if we start from any element in the derived array and apply the XOR operation in reverse, we should end up back at the original array.\n\n3. **Parity Check**: Since the derived array contains only 0s and 1s, the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of 1s in the derived array will determine the parity of the number of 1s in the original array. Specifically:\n   - If the number of 1s in `derived` is even, the number of 1s in `original` must also be even.\n   - If the number of 1s in `derived` is odd, the number of 1s in `original` must also be odd.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the constraints, if the number of 1s in `derived` is even, then `original` must also be even. If the number of 1s in `derived` is odd, then `original` must also be odd. However, since the problem states that `derived` contains only 0s and 1s, the number of 1s in `derived` can only be even or odd. Therefore, the condition that the number of 1s in `derived` is even implies that `original` must also be even.\n\n5. **Implementation**: We can implement this logic in Python as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def doesValidArrayExist(self, derived: List[int]) -> bool:\n        # Count the number of 1s in the derived array\n        num_ones = sum(derived)\n        \n        # Check if the number of 1s is even\n        return num_ones % 2 == 0\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n- We count the number of 1s in the `derived` array using the `sum` function.\n- We then check if the count of 1s is even using the modulo operator `%`. If it is even, the original array must also be even, so we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly determine if there exists a valid binary array `original` based on the given `derived` array.", "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a binary array `original` that, when bitwise XORed with its adjacent elements, results in the given `derived` array.

If it's odd, it's impossible to form a valid `original` array because the XOR operation would result in an odd number of changes, which cannot be achieved with an even-length array.\n\n2. **Initialize Original Array**: We initialize the first element of the `original` array with the last element of the `derived` array. This is because the XOR operation between any element and itself is zero, so the first element of the `original` array will remain unchanged after all operations.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Derived Array**: We iterate through the `derived` array starting from the second element. For each element, we calculate the next element in the `original` array using the bitwise XOR operation with the previous element.\n\n4. **Check Final Result**: After processing all elements in the `derived` array, we check if the last element of the `original` array matches the first element of the `derived` array.

Finally, we return the `ans` list containing the distinct difference array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required array in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the input array.", "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distinct difference array for each element in the input list `nums`. The distinct difference array at each position `i` should be the number of unique elements in the suffix of `nums` starting from `i+1` minus the number of unique elements in the prefix of `nums` up to `i`.\n\nHere's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def distinctDifferenceArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Create two lists to store the count of unique elements in the prefix and suffix\n        prefix_count = [0] * len(nums)\n        suffix_count = [0] * len(nums)\n        \n        # Count unique elements in the prefix\n        unique_elements = set()\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            unique_elements.add(nums[i])\n            prefix_count[i] = len(unique_elements)\n        \n        # Count unique elements in the suffix\n        unique_elements = set()\n        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):\n            unique_elements.add(nums[i])\n            suffix_count[i] = len(unique_elements)\n        \n        # Calculate the distinct difference array\n        result = []\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            result.append(prefix_count[i] - suffix_count[i + 1])\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. We initialize two lists, `prefix_count` and `suffix_count`, both of length `len(nums)` initialized to zero. These lists will store the count of unique elements in the prefix and suffix, respectively.\n\n2. We iterate through the list `nums` once from left to right. For each element, we add it to the set of unique elements encountered so far and update the corresponding entry in `prefix_count`.\n\n3. Similarly, we iterate through the list `nums` from right to left. For each element, we add it to the set of unique elements encountered so far and update the corresponding entry in `suffix_count`.\n\n4. Finally, we calculate the distinct difference array by subtracting the value in `suffix_count` for the next position (i.e., `suffix_count[i + 1]`) from the value in `prefix_count` for the current position (`prefix_count[i]`). This gives us the required distinct difference for each element.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the distinct difference array with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.", "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of sets to keep track of the distinct elements in the prefix and suffix of the array.

If the next move leads to a valid neighbor, we add it to the priority queue with the updated total cost.\n\n6. **Check Target**: Once we reach the target node, we return the total cost.\n\n7. **Handle No Path**: If no path is found after exploring all possibilities, we return -1, although this should not happen given the constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimum cost required to go from the start to the target, considering both regular paths and special roads.", "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost to reach the target position from the starting position using the given special roads.

We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the input array.\n2. We create a list of lists called `result` with the same length as the maximum frequency found in the counter. This ensures that each row in the 2D array has a distinct set of elements.\n3. We iterate through the counter items and distribute the elements into the appropriate rows. For each element, we append it to the current row until its count reaches zero, then move to the next row.\n\nThis approach ensures that we create the minimal possible 2D array while meeting the specified conditions.

For the **i****th** position in `banned`, `arr[banned[i]] = 0`, and `banned[i] != p`.\n\n\nYou can perform **multiple** operations on `arr`.

Initially, 1is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is 0. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1.

If either bound is in the banned list, we adjust it accordingly.

We initialize a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a score of `j` using the first `i` types of questions.\n\n2. We set the base case where `dp[0][0]` is 1 because there's exactly one way to achieve a score of 0 (doing nothing).\n\n3. We iterate through each type of question and update the DP table accordingly. For each type, we consider all possible counts of questions we can take and add the corresponding number of ways to reach the remaining score to the current cell.\n\n4.

We define a helper function `dp` that takes two parameters: `index`, which represents the current type of question being considered, and `current_points`, which represents the total points earned so far.\n2. The base case of the recursion is when `index` exceeds the length of `types`. In this case, we return 0 because there are no more types to consider.\n3. We calculate the maximum number of questions we can take from the current type using `min(current_points // types[index][1], types[index][0])`.\n4. We recursively call `dp` for two scenarios:\n   - Skipping the current type by passing `index + 1` and `current_points`.\n   - Taking the maximum number of questions from the current type by passing `index + 1` and `current_points - max_questions * types[index][1]`.\n5. We combine the results of these two scenarios and return the total number of ways.\n6.

The `@lru_cache(None)` decorator caches the results of expensive function calls, making subsequent calls for the same inputs faster.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n1. If the target is negative, it's impossible to reach the target, so we return 0.\n2. We initialize the result `res` to 0.\n3.

Here's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import *\nfrom collections import *\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxNumOfMarkedIndices(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Sort the array in ascending order\n        nums.sort()\n        \n        # Initialize pointers for the smallest and largest elements\n        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1\n        \n        # Initialize the count of marked indices\n        cnt = 0\n        \n        # Iterate while the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer\n        while l <= r:\n            # Check if the current pair satisfies the condition\n            if 2 * nums[l] <= nums[r]:\n                # Increment the count of marked indices\n                cnt += 2\n                # Move both pointers towards each other\n                l += 1\n                r -= 1\n            else:\n                # Move the right pointer to the left\n                r -= 1\n        \n        return cnt\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: We sort the array in ascending order to simplify the comparison process.\n\n2. **Initialize Pointers**: We initialize two pointers, `l` starting from the beginning of the array and `r` starting from the end of the array.\n\n3. **Count Marked Indices**: We iterate while the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer. For each pair `(nums[l], nums[r])`, we check if `2 * nums[l] <= nums[r]`. If it is, we increment the count of marked indices by 2 (since both `l` and `r` will be marked), and move both pointers towards each other. If not, we only move the right pointer to the left.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the count of marked indices.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of marked indices by always picking the smallest available element for the left pointer and the largest available element for the right pointer that satisfy the given condition.", "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of marked indices by ensuring that for each marked index `i`, the condition `2 * nums[i] <= nums[j]` holds for some other unmarked index `j`.

This allows us to efficiently check pairs of elements where one is twice the size of the other.\n\n2. **Initialize Pointers**: We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the start and end of the sorted array, respectively.\n\n3. **Count Marked Indices**: We use a loop to iterate through the array with these pointers.

If the condition is true, it means we can mark both elements, increment the count, and move both pointers inward.

Since we used negative values in the heap, we multiply the result by -1 to get the correct count of remaining gifts.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always process the pile with the most gifts first, which helps in minimizing the total number of gifts taken over time. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the initial heap conversion and O(k log n) for each of the k operations, resulting in a total time complexity of O(n log n + k log n).

We convert the list of gifts into a max heap using a min heap data structure from the `heapq` module. This allows us to efficiently access the largest element in constant time.\n\n2. We then perform the process of picking gifts for \\( k \\) seconds. For each second, we:\n   - Pop the largest element from the heap.\n   - Calculate the new value after taking the floor of the square root.\n   - Push the new value back into the heap.\n\n3. Finally, we return the sum of the remaining gifts by converting them back to negative values and summing them up.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always use the largest available gift in each step, and it efficiently simulates the process over \\( k \\) seconds.

The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the heap.", "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of choosing the pile with the maximum number of gifts, leaving behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts, and taking the rest of the gifts.

For each element `nums[i]`, we calculate the number of valid quadruplets ending at `(i, j)` where `j` is greater than `i`.\n\n4. We update the prefix sum `pre` for the current index `i`.\n\n5. Finally, we return the total number of valid quadruplets.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of increasing quadruplets using a combination of dynamic programming and binary search. The time complexity is O(n^2 log n), which is acceptable given the constraints.", "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of sorting and prefix sums to efficiently count the number of increasing quadruplets. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countQuadruplets(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Sort the array\n        nums.sort()\n        \n        # Initialize the result variable\n        ans = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each possible value for the first element of the quadruplet\n        for i in range(len(nums) - 3):\n            # Use a dictionary to store the count of numbers less than the current element\n            cnt = {}\n            \n            # Iterate over each possible value for the third element of the quadruplet\n            for k in range(i + 1, len(nums) - 2):\n                # Check if there are enough numbers greater than the current element\n                if k > i + 2 and nums[k] >= nums[i]:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Calculate the number of valid pairs (j, l) where j < k < l and nums[j] < nums[l]\n                j = bisect.bisect_left(nums, nums[k])\n                l = bisect.bisect_right(nums, nums[k])\n                \n                # Update the result using the prefix sum approach\n                ans += j * (len(nums) - k - 1)\n                ans -= l * (k - i - 1)\n                \n                # Update the count dictionary\n                cnt[nums[k]] = cnt.get(nums[k], 0) + 1\n        \n        return ans\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: First, we sort the array to simplify the search for valid pairs and triples.\n\n2. **Initialize Result Variable**: We initialize a variable `ans` to keep track of the number of increasing quadruplets.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Each Possible Value for the First Element**: For each possible value `i` from the start of the array up to the second last element, we create a dictionary `cnt` to store the count of numbers less than the current element `nums[i]`.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Each Possible Value for the Third Element**: For each possible value `k` starting from `i+1` up to the second last element, we check if there are enough numbers greater than `nums[k]`. If not, we skip to the next iteration.\n\n5. **Calculate Valid Pairs (j, l)**: Using binary search (`bisect.bisect_left` and `bisect.bisect_right`), we find the indices `j` and `l` such that `nums[j] < nums[k]` and `nums[l] < nums[k]`. The number of valid pairs (j, l) where `j < k < l` is given by `j * (len(nums) - k - 1)` and `l * (k - i - 1)`.\n\n6. **Update Result**: We update the result using the prefix sum approach. This involves subtracting the count of invalid pairs (where `j >= k`) from the total count of valid pairs.\n\n7. **Update Count Dictionary**: Finally, we update the count dictionary `cnt` to account for the new pair `(k, nums[k])`.\n\n8. **Return Result**: After iterating through all possible values for `i` and `k`, we return the final result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of increasing quadruplets with a time complexity of O(n^3 log n), which is within the constraints provided."], "input_token_count": 418, "output_token_counts": [509, 515, 543, 480, 748], "total_token_counts": [927, 933, 961, 898, 1166], "pass_rate": 0.0, "results": [false, false, false, false, false], "thinking_time": [137.0, 158.0, 124.0, 147.0, 80.0], "average_thinking_time": 136.0}
