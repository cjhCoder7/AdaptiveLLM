Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment.

You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nYou are given an integer array a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j. For example, the array d = [5, 3, 7, 5] has exactly two inversions \u2014 (1, 2) and (3, 4), since d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2 and d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 array size.

Note that in this problem, unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2.

Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3.

Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length d. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways.\n\nBecause of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station.\n\nDue to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably.

Note that for any two nodes, there is exactly one simple path between them, where a simple path is a path between two nodes that does not contain any node more than once.\n\nHere is an example of a tree: \n\n<image>\n\nA restriction consists of 3 pairwise distinct integers, a, b, and c (1 \u2264 a,b,c \u2264 n).

Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries.\n\nA query consists of an array a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n of integers between 1 and n. a is not required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of a and p, meaning that he will compute an array s where s_j = p_j + a_j for all j = 1, 2, \u2026, n. Then, he will find the smallest index k such that s_k occurs more than once in s, and answer with k. If there is no such index k, then he will answer with 0.\n\nYou can perform at most 2n queries. Figure out the meaning of life p.\n\nInteraction\n\nStart the interaction by reading single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the permutation p.\n\nYou can then make queries. A query consists of a single line \"? \\enspace a_1 \\enspace a_2 \\enspace \u2026 \\enspace a_n\" (1 \u2264 a_j \u2264 n).\n\nThe answer to each query will be a single integer k as described above (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n).\n\nAfter making a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n  * System.out.flush() in Java;\n  * flush(output) in Pascal;\n  * stdout.flush() in Python;\n  * see documentation for other languages.\n\n\n\nTo output your answer, print a single line \"! \\enspace p_1 \\enspace p_2 \\enspace \u2026 \\enspace p_n\" then terminate.\n\nYou can make at most 2n queries.

Three queries were made.\n\nThe first query is a = [4, 4, 2, 3, 2]. This yields s = [3 + 4, 2 + 4, 1 + 2, 5 + 3, 4 + 2] = [7, 6, 3, 8, 6]. 6 is the only number that appears more than once, and it appears first at index 2, making the answer to the query 2.\n\nThe second query is a = [3, 5, 1, 5, 5]. This yields s = [3 + 3, 2 + 5, 1 + 1, 5 + 5, 4 + 5] = [6, 7, 2, 10, 9]. There are no numbers that appear more than once here, so the answer to the query is 0.\n\nThe third query is a = [5, 2, 4, 3, 1]. This yields s = [3 + 5, 2 + 2, 1 + 4, 5 + 3, 4 + 1] = [8, 4, 5, 8, 5]. 5 and 8 both occur more than once here. 5 first appears at index 3, while 8 first appears at index 1, and 1 < 3, making the answer to the query 1.\n\nNote that the sample is only meant to provide an example of how the interaction works; it is not guaranteed that the above queries represent a correct strategy with which to determine the answer.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Nodes are labeled from 1 to n.

Unfortunately, he doesn't know when he needs to complete the tasks.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Time travel will now happen according to the following rules:\n\n  * For each k = 1, 2, \u2026, n, Okabe will realize at time b_k that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k (a_k < b_k). \n\n  * When he realizes this, if k-th task was already completed at time a_k, Okabe keeps the usual flow of time. Otherwise, he time travels to time a_k then immediately completes the task.\n\n  * If Okabe time travels to time a_k, all tasks completed after this time will become incomplete again. That is, for every j, if a_j>a_k, the j-th task will become incomplete, if it was complete (if it was incomplete, nothing will change).\n\n  * Okabe has bad memory, so he can time travel to time a_k only immediately after getting to time b_k and learning that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k. That is, even if Okabe already had to perform k-th task before, he wouldn't remember it before stumbling on the info about this task at time b_k again.\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the notes for an example of time travelling.\n\nThere is a certain set s of tasks such that the first moment that all of the tasks in s are simultaneously completed (regardless of whether any other tasks are currently completed), a funny scene will take place.

Nothing happens until time 3, when Okabe realizes that he should have done the 2-nd task at time 2. He then time travels to time 2 and completes the task.\n\nAs the task is done now, he does not time travel again when the time is again 3. However, at time 4, he travels to time 1 to complete the 1-st task.\n\nThis undoes the 2-nd task. This means that the 2-nd task is not currently completed, meaning that the funny scene will not occur at this point even though the 1-st task is currently completed and Okabe had previously completed the 2-nd task.\n\nOnce it is again time 3 he travels back to time 2 once more and does the 2-nd task again.\n\nNow all tasks are complete, with Okabe having time travelled 3 times.\n\nThe second sample has the same tasks for Okabe to complete.

However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines. The i-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the i-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the i-th tour group.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n1 2 4 7\n1 3 2 8\n2 4 8 2\n2 5 1 1\n1 3\n9 5\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 8\n3 0\n3 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 4 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 2 1\n2 5 1 1\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 8\n1 3 6 3\n1 4 4 5\n1 5 7 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 8\n2 8\n2 3\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNote\n\nA map of the first sample is shown below. For the nodes, unbolded numbers represent indices and bolded numbers represent enjoyment values. For the edges, unbolded numbers represent capacities and bolded numbers represent tolls.\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 3 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 5 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

When the mosaic is complete, each cell in the grid will have either a glaucous or sinoper tile. However, currently he has only placed tiles in some cells. \n\nA completed mosaic will be a mastapeece if and only if each tile is adjacent to exactly 2 tiles of the same color (2 tiles are adjacent if they share a side.)

It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.\n\nIn the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 8 \u2192 7 \u2192 0 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 (-5) \u2192 (-10) \u2192 (-15), with distance 41.

The world you live in is a giant 10^9 \u00d7 10^9 grid, with squares having both coordinates between 1 and 10^9. \n\nYou know that the enemy base has the shape of a rectangle, with the sides parallel to the sides of the grid. The people of your world are extremely scared of being at the edge of the world, so you know that the base doesn't contain any of the squares on the edges of the grid (the x or y coordinate being 1 or 10^9). \n\nTo help you locate the base, you have been given a device that you can place in any square of the grid, and it will tell you the manhattan distance to the closest square of the base. The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a\u2212p|+|b\u2212q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy. Because of this, you need to make sure to never place the device inside the enemy base. \n\nUnfortunately, the device is powered by a battery and you can't recharge it. This means that you can use the device at most 40 times. \n\nInput\n\nThe input contains the answers to your queries. \n\nInteraction\n\nYour code is allowed to place the device on any square in the grid by writing \"? i j\" (1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 10^9). In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square (i,j) or -1 if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid. \n\nIf you recieve -1 instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than 40 queries. \n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \"! x y p q\" (1 \u2264 x \u2264 p\u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 q\u2264 10^9), where (x, y) is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest x and y coordinates, and (p, q) is the square inside the enemy base with the largest x and y coordinates. Note that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: \n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * See the documentation for other languages.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n? 2 2\n? 5 5\n? 4 7\n? 1 5\n! 2 3 4 5\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

The game continues until one player cannot make a move, indicating that the other player has won.", "Here's a possible implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef array_game(A):\n    N = len(A)\n    left, right = 0, N - 1\n    alice_turn = True\n    while left <= right:\n        if alice_turn:\n            if A[left] < A[right]:\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                right -= 1\n        else:\n            if A[left] > A[right]:\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                right -= 1\n        alice_turn = not alice_turn\n    return \"Alice\" if alice_turn else \"Bob\"\n```\n\nThe function `array_game` takes an array `A` as input and returns the name of the winner. It uses a greedy approach to determine the optimal moves for both players. The variable `alice_turn` tracks whose turn it is, and the variable `left` and `right` keep track of the left and right indices of the array that are still available for removal.\n\nThe function iterates through the array, and in each iteration, it checks whether it is Alice's turn. If it is, the function checks whether the number at the left index is smaller than the number at the right index. If it is, it removes the number at the left index and appends it to the sequence. Otherwise, it removes the number at the right index and appends it to the sequence. The variable `alice_turn` is set to `False` to indicate that it is now Bob's turn.\n\nIf it is Bob's turn, the function checks whether the number at the left index is greater than the number at the right index. If it is, it removes the number at the left index and appends it to the sequence. Otherwise, it removes the number at the right index and appends it to the sequence. The variable `alice_turn` is set to `True` to indicate that it is now Alice's turn.\n\nThe loop continues until both the left and right indices cross each other, indicating that there are no more available numbers to remove. The function then returns the name of the winner based on the value of `alice_turn`. If it is `True`, it means that Alice was the last to make a move, and she is the winner. Otherwise, Bob is the winner.", "Here is a Python implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\ndef array_game(A):\n    N = len(A)\n    dp = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]\n    for i in range(N):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n    for length in range(2, N + 1):\n        for i in range(N - length + 1):\n            j = i + length - 1\n            dp[i][j] = 1 - dp[i + 1][j]\n            if A[i] > A[i + 1] and dp[i + 2][j] == 0:\n                dp[i][j] = 1\n            if A[j] > A[j - 1] and dp[i][j - 2] == 0:\n                dp[i][j] = 1\n\n    return \"Alice\" if dp[0][N - 1] == 1 else \"Bob\"\n```\n\nThis implementation uses dynamic programming to determine the winner of the game. The function `array_game` takes an array `A` as input and returns the name of the winner (\"Alice\" or \"Bob\").\n\nThe function first initializes a 2D array `dp` of size `N x N`, where `N` is the length of the array `A`. Each cell `dp[i][j]` in this array represents the winner of the subarray `A[i:j+1]`, where `0 <= i <= j < N`.\n\nThe function then fills the `dp` array using dynamic programming. It starts with subarrays of length 1, where the winner is determined by comparing the first and second elements of the subarray. It then moves on to subarrays of length 2, where the winner is determined by comparing the first and third elements of the subarray. This process continues until the entire `dp` array is filled.\n\nFinally, the function returns the name of the winner based on the value in `dp[0][N-1]`, where `0` represents \"Alice\" and `1` represents \"Bob\".", "To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by sorting the array in ascending order. Then, we can iterate through the array and check if the current element is greater than the previous element.

After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the values of the lights on the edges in that path.\n\nHowever, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned (a_i, b_i), as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of 1's when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even.\n\nHelp Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the size of tree and the number of elves respectively.\n\nThe next n-1 lines of each test case each contains three integers, x, y, and v (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; -1 \u2264 v < 2^{30}) \u2014 meaning that there's an edge between nodes x and y. If \n\n  * v = -1: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. \n  * v \u2265 0: The set of lights on the edge is v. \n\n\n\nThe next m lines of each test case each contains three integers, a, b, and p (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n; a \u2260 b; 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1) \u2014 the nodes that the elf was assigned to, and the parity of the number of set bits in the elf's favorite number.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n and the sum of all m don't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 each.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first print either YES or NO (in any case), whether there's a tree consistent with Santa's memory or not. \n\nIf the answer is YES, print n-1 lines each containing three integers: x, y, and v (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; 0 \u2264 v < 2^{30}) \u2014 the edge and the integer on that edge. The set of edges must be the same as in the input, and if the value of some edge was specified earlier, it can not change. You can print the edges in any order.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n6 5\n1 2 -1\n1 3 1\n4 2 7\n6 3 0\n2 5 -1\n2 3 1\n2 5 0\n5 6 1\n6 1 1\n4 5 1\n5 3\n1 2 -1\n1 3 -1\n1 4 1\n4 5 -1\n2 4 0\n3 4 1\n2 3 1\n3 3\n1 2 -1\n1 3 -1\n1 2 0\n1 3 1\n2 3 0\n2 1\n1 2 1\n1 2 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\n1 2 0\n1 3 1\n2 4 7\n3 6 0\n2 5 0\nYES\n1 2 1\n1 3 0\n1 4 1\n4 5 1\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first test case is the image in the statement.\n\nOne possible answer is assigning the value of the edge (1, 2) to 5, and the value of the edge (2, 5) to 3. This is correct because: \n\n  * The first elf goes from node 2 to node 3. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the value 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The second elf goes from node 2 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 3, so he remembers the value 0 (as 3 has an even number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The third elf goes from node 5 to node 6. This elf's favorite number is 7, so he remembers the value 1 (as 7 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fourth elf goes from node 6 to node 1. This elf's favorite number is 1, so he remembers the value 1 (as 1 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fifth elf goes from node 4 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the number 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n\n\n\nNote that there are other possible answers.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

The mischievous duo is now vandalizing a rooted tree, by coloring the nodes while playing their favorite game.\n\nThe game works as follows: there is a tree of size n, rooted at node 1, where each node is initially white. Red and Blue get one turn each. Red goes first. \n\nIn Red's turn, he can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree red. \n\nHowever, to make the game fair, Red is only allowed to color k nodes of the tree. In other words, after Red's turn, at most k of the nodes can be colored red.\n\nThen, it's Blue's turn. Blue can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree blue. However, he's not allowed to choose a subtree that contains a node already colored red, as that would make the node purple and no one likes purple crayon. \n\nNote: there's no restriction on the number of nodes Blue can color, as long as he doesn't color a node that Red has already colored.\n\nAfter the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let w be the number of white nodes, r be the number of red nodes, and b be the number of blue nodes.

You can only add or remove Lego's at two adjacent positions at the same time, as otherwise your chubby fingers run into precision issues.\n\nYou want to know exactly how much time you'll spend playing with Legos. You value efficiency, so given some starting state and some ending state, you'll always spend the least number of seconds to transform the starting state into the ending state. If it's impossible to transform the starting state into the ending state, you just skip it (so you spend 0 seconds).\n\nThe issue is that, for some positions, you don't remember whether there were Legos there or not (in either the starting state, the ending state, or both). Over all pairs of (starting state, ending state) that are consistent with your memory, find the total amount of time it will take to transform the starting state to the ending state. Print this value modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7). \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the size of the Lego strip.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string s of length n, consisting of the characters 0, 1, and ? \u2014 your memory of the starting state: \n\n  * 1 represents a position that definitely has a Lego piece, \n  * 0 represents a position that definitely does not have a Lego piece, \n  * and ? represents a position that you don't remember. \n\n\n\nThe third line of each test case contains a string t of length n, consisting of the characters 0, 1, and ? \u2014 your memory of the ending state. It follows a similar format to the starting state.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2000.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7). \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2\n00\n11\n3\n???\n???\n3\n??1\n0?0\n4\n??0?\n??11\n5\n?????\n0??1?\n10\n?01??01?1?\n??100?1???\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n16\n1\n14\n101\n1674\n\nNote\n\nFor the first test case, 00 is the only possible starting state, and 11 is the only possible ending state. It takes exactly one operation to change 00 to 11.\n\nFor the second test case, some of the possible starting and ending state pairs are: \n\n  * (000, 011) \u2014 takes 1 operation. \n  * (001, 100) \u2014 takes 2 operations. \n  * (010, 000) \u2014 takes 0 operations, as it's impossible to achieve the ending state. \n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

The only difference between the easy and hard version is the limit on number of questions.\n\nThere are n players labelled from 1 to n. It is guaranteed that n is a multiple of 3.\n\nAmong them, there are k impostors and n-k crewmates. The number of impostors, k, is not given to you. It is guaranteed that n/3 < k < 2n/3.\n\nIn each question, you can choose three distinct integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 n) and ask: \"Among the players labelled a, b and c, are there more impostors or more crewmates?\" You will be given the integer 0 if there are more impostors than crewmates, and 1 otherwise.\n\nFind the number of impostors k and the indices of players that are impostors after asking at most n+6 questions.\n\nThe jury is adaptive, which means the indices of impostors may not be fixed beforehand and can depend on your questions. It is guaranteed that there is at least one set of impostors which fulfills the constraints and the answers to your questions at any time.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer n (6 \u2264 n < 10^4, n is a multiple of 3) \u2014 the number of players.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^4.\n\nInteraction\n\nFor each test case, the interaction starts with reading n.\n\nThen you are allowed to make at most n+6 questions in the following way:\n\n\"? a b c\" (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 n, a, b and c are pairwise distinct).\n\nAfter each one, you should read an integer r, which is equal to 0 if there are more impostors than crewmates among players labelled a, b and c, and equal to 1 otherwise.\n\nAnswer -1 instead of 0 or 1 means that you made an invalid query. Exit immediately after receiving -1 and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nWhen you have found the indices of all impostors, print a single line \"! \" (without quotes), followed by the number of impostors k, followed by k integers representing the indices of the impostors. Please note that you must print all this information on the same line. \n\nAfter printing the answer, your program must then continue to solve the remaining test cases, or exit if all test cases have been solved.\n\nAfter printing the queries and answers do not forget to output end of line and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will get the Idleness limit exceeded verdict.

We can start by guessing the number of impostors as n/3 and then ask questions to verify our guess. If the answer to a question is 0, we know that the number of impostors is less than or equal to our guess. If the answer is 1, we know that the number of impostors is greater than our guess. We can then use this information to narrow down the search space and find the exact number of impostors.\n\nHere is a Python implementation of this approach:\n\n```python\ndef find_impostors(n):\n    left, right = n // 3, n - 1\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        a, b, c = 1, 2, mid + 1\n        print(f\"? {a} {b} {c}\")\n        r = int(input())\n        if r == 0:\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    k = left\n    impostors = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        a, b, c = i, i + 1, i + 2\n        if c > n:\n            c -= n\n        print(f\"? {a} {b} {c}\")\n        r = int(input())\n        if r == 0:\n            impostors.append(i)\n\n    return k, impostors\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a binary search to find the number of impostors. We start by setting the left and right boundaries of the search space to n/3 and n-1, respectively. Then, we repeatedly guess the number of impostors by taking the midpoint of the search space and asking the question \"? a b c\" with a = 1, b = 2, and c = mid + 1. If the answer r is 0, we know that the number of impostors is less than or equal to mid, so we set right = mid. Otherwise, if r is 1, we know that the number of impostors is greater than mid, so we set left = mid + 1.\n\nOnce we find the exact number of impostors k, we can use a similar approach to find the indices of the impostors. We iterate over all possible triplets of players a, b, and c and ask the question \"? a b c\". If the answer r is 0, we know that the number of impostors is greater than or equal to 2, so we add the index i to the list of impostors.\n\nFinally, we return the number of impostors k and the list of impostors.", "Here is a Python implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\ndef solve_test_case(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a test case with n players.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 6:\n        print(\"?

Icy wants to make at least one pair of chocolates the same type. \n\nAs a result, she asks her grandparents to perform some chocolate exchanges. Before performing any chocolate exchanges, Icy chooses two chocolates with indices x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n, x \u2260 y).\n\nIn a chocolate exchange, Icy's grandparents choose a non-negative integer k, such that 2^k \u2265 a_x, and change the type of the chocolate x from a_x to 2^k - a_x (that is, perform a_x := 2^k - a_x).\n\nThe chocolate exchanges will be stopped only when a_x = a_y. Note that other pairs of equal chocolate types do not stop the procedure.\n\nIcy's grandparents are smart, so they would choose the sequence of chocolate exchanges that minimizes the number of exchanges needed. Since Icy likes causing trouble, she wants to maximize the minimum number of exchanges needed by choosing x and y appropriately. She wonders what is the optimal pair (x, y) such that the minimum number of exchanges needed is maximized across all possible choices of (x, y).\n\nSince Icy is not good at math, she hopes that you can help her solve the problem.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of chocolates.\n\nThe second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that all a_i are distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput three integers x, y, and m.\n\nx and y are indices of the optimal chocolates to perform exchanges on.

If Monocarp's chosen item has price x, then he can trade it for any item (exactly one item) with price not greater than x+k.\n\nMonocarp initially has n items, the price of the i-th item he has is a_i.

Note that if Monocarp gets some item during an exchange, he can trade it for another item (since now the item belongs to him), and vice versa: if Monocarp trades one of his items for another item, he can get his item back by trading something for it.\n\nYou have to answer q queries. Each query consists of one integer, which is the value of k, and asks you to calculate the maximum possible total cost of items Monocarp can have after some sequence of trades, assuming that he can trade an item of cost x for an item of cost not greater than x+k during each trade.

{"id": "code_contests/163", "prompt": "# Robot Cleaner Revisit\n\nThe statement of this problem shares a lot with problem A. The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not \u2261 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x \u22c5 y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 \u2264 a < 10^9 + 7 and a \u22c5 y \u2261 x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10).

Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same.

{"id": "code_contests/164", "prompt": "# Middle Duplication\n\nA binary tree of n nodes is given. Nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to n and the root is the node 1. Each node can have no child, only one left child, only one right child, or both children. For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child.\n\nEach node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k. What is the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree, if we can duplicate labels of at most k nodes?\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: \n\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a \u2260 b; \n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains a string c of n lower-case English letters, where c_i is the initial label of the node i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Note that the given string c is not the initial string representation of the tree.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (0 \u2264 l_i, r_i \u2264 n). If the node i does not have the left child, l_i = 0, and if the node i does not have the right child, r_i = 0.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given input forms a binary tree, rooted at 1.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single line, containing the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree if at most k nodes have their labels duplicated.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n4 3\nabab\n2 3\n0 0\n0 4\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nbaaaab\n\nInput\n\n\n8 2\nkadracyn\n2 5\n3 4\n0 0\n0 0\n6 8\n0 7\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\ndaarkkcyan\n\nInput\n\n\n8 3\nkdaracyn\n2 5\n0 3\n0 4\n0 0\n6 8\n0 7\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\ndarkcyan\n\nNote\n\nThe images below present the tree for the examples. The number in each node is the node number, while the subscripted letter is its label. To the right is the string representation of the tree, with each letter having the same color as the corresponding node.\n\nHere is the tree for the first example. Here we duplicated the labels of nodes 1 and 3. We should not duplicate the label of node 2 because it would give us the string \"bbaaab\", which is lexicographically greater than \"baaaab\".\n\n<image>\n\nIn the second example, we can duplicate the labels of nodes 1 and 2. Note that only duplicating the label of the root will produce a worse result than the initial string.\n\n<image>\n\nIn the third example, we should not duplicate any character at all. Even though we would want to duplicate the label of the node 3, by duplicating it we must also duplicate the label of the node 2, which produces a worse result.\n\n<image>\n\nThere is no way to produce string \"darkkcyan\" from a tree with the initial string representation \"darkcyan\" :(.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.
