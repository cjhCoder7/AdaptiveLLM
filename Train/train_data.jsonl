{"id": "code_contests/24", "prompt": "# Railway Construction\n\nBecause the railway system in Gensokyo is often congested, as an enthusiastic engineer, Kawasiro Nitori plans to construct more railway to ease the congestion.\n\nThere are n stations numbered from 1 to n and m two-way railways in Gensokyo. Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length d. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways.\n\nBecause of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station.\n\nDue to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th event will add additional amount of x_i to the cost of building a new railway from the station k_i.\n\nTo save resources, before all incidents and after each incident, Nitori wants you to help her calculate the minimal cost of railway construction.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 q \u2264 2\u22c510^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers w_1,w_2,\u2026,w_n (1 \u2264 w_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, d (1 \u2264 u,v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^9), denoting a two-way railway connecting station u and station v, with length d.\n\nThe i-th of the next q lines contains two integers k_i,x_i (1 \u2264 k_i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 x_i \u2264 4 \u00d7 10^8).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q+1 lines, and the i-th of these lines contains one integer, denoting the minimal cost of railway construction after the i-1-th incident (especially, the 0-th incident means no incident occurred).\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 4 1\n3 5 1\n4 5 1\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n9\n\n\nInput\n\n\n8 11 0\n14 4 16 15 1 3 1 14\n4 2 1\n1 2 3\n7 5 4\n2 3 1\n8 6 2\n8 5 5\n5 4 5\n7 6 7\n3 5 5\n1 6 6\n8 1 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n46\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10 16 8\n29 1 75 73 51 69 24 17 1 97\n1 2 18\n2 3 254\n2 4 546\n2 5 789\n5 6 998\n6 7 233\n7 8 433\n1 9 248\n5 10 488\n2 6 1787\n10 8 1176\n3 8 2199\n4 8 1907\n2 10 1277\n4 10 731\n9 10 1047\n1 11\n1 9\n8 8\n1 3\n2 19\n9 5\n9 4\n7 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n34\n45\n54\n54\n57\n76\n96\n112\n112\n\nNote\n\nIn the second example, Nitori can build railways as follows: 1 \u2192 2, 1 \u2192 3, 1 \u2192 4, 2 \u2192 8, and the cost is 14 + 14 + 14 + 4 = 46.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "code_contests/43", "prompt": "# Omkar and Tours\n\nOmkar is hosting tours of his country, Omkarland! There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines. The i-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the i-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the i-th tour group.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n1 2 4 7\n1 3 2 8\n2 4 8 2\n2 5 1 1\n1 3\n9 5\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 8\n3 0\n3 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 4 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 2 1\n2 5 1 1\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 8\n1 3 6 3\n1 4 4 5\n1 5 7 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 8\n2 8\n2 3\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNote\n\nA map of the first sample is shown below. For the nodes, unbolded numbers represent indices and bolded numbers represent enjoyment values. For the edges, unbolded numbers represent capacities and bolded numbers represent tolls.\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 3 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).\n\nCasimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: \n\n  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. \n  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. \n  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j \u00b1 h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. \n\n\n\nAn already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 \u00d7 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.\n\n<image>\n\nYou are given a description of a checkered field of size n \u00d7 m.

This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \\color{blue}{blue}, \\color{red}{red} and \\color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  \n---  \n*\\color{blue}{*}**  \n.\\color{green}{*}\\color{red}{*}.  \n....  \n  \nThe field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2.

Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k.

After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the values of the lights on the edges in that path.\n\nHowever, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned (a_i, b_i), as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number.

If there is such a direction, then it will move to a neighbouring cell in that direction. Otherwise, it will do nothing.\n\nWe want to get the robot to the lab to get it fixed. For each free cell, determine if the robot can be forced to reach the lab starting in this cell. That is, after each step of the robot a command can be sent to a robot such that no matter what different directions the robot chooses, it will end up in a lab.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6; n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines provides a description of the i-th row of the grid. It consists of m elements of one of three types: \n\n  * '.' \u2014 the cell is free; \n  * '#' \u2014 the cell is blocked; \n  * 'L' \u2014 the cell contains a lab. \n\n\n\nThe grid contains exactly one lab. The sum of n \u22c5 m over all testcases doesn't exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase find the free cells that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. Given the grid, replace the free cells (marked with a dot) with a plus sign ('+') for the cells that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. Print the resulting grid.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3 3\n...\n.L.\n...\n4 5\n#....\n..##L\n...#.\n.....\n1 1\nL\n1 9\n....L..#.\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n...\n.L.\n...\n#++++\n..##L\n...#+\n...++\nL\n++++L++#.\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase there is no free cell that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. Consider a corner cell. Given any direction, it will move to a neighbouring border grid that's not a corner. Now consider a non-corner free cell. No matter what direction you send to the robot, it can choose a different direction such that it ends up in a corner.\n\nIn the last testcase, you can keep sending the command that is opposite to the direction to the lab and the robot will have no choice other than move towards the lab.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries.\n\nA query consists of an array a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n of integers between 1 and n. a is not required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of a and p, meaning that he will compute an array s where s_j = p_j + a_j for all j = 1, 2, \u2026, n. Then, he will find the smallest index k such that s_k occurs more than once in s, and answer with k. If there is no such index k, then he will answer with 0.\n\nYou can perform at most 2n queries. Figure out the meaning of life p.\n\nInteraction\n\nStart the interaction by reading single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the permutation p.\n\nYou can then make queries.

Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n  * System.out.flush() in Java;\n  * flush(output) in Pascal;\n  * stdout.flush() in Python;\n  * see documentation for other languages.\n\n\n\nTo output your answer, print a single line \"! \\enspace p_1 \\enspace p_2 \\enspace \u2026 \\enspace p_n\" then terminate.\n\nYou can make at most 2n queries.

This yields s = [3 + 3, 2 + 5, 1 + 1, 5 + 5, 4 + 5] = [6, 7, 2, 10, 9]. There are no numbers that appear more than once here, so the answer to the query is 0.\n\nThe third query is a = [5, 2, 4, 3, 1].

Note that you can exit the grid from any leftmost empty cell (cell in the first column) by going left, and from any topmost empty cell (cell in the first row) by going up.\n\nLet's call a grid determinable if, given only which cells are exitable, we can exactly determine which cells are filled in and which aren't.\n\nYou are given a grid a of dimensions n \u00d7 m , i. e. a grid with n rows and m columns. You need to answer q queries (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5). Each query gives two integers x_1, x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m) and asks whether the subgrid of a consisting of the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6, nm \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the dimensions of the grid a.\n\nn lines follow. The y-th line contains m characters, the x-th of which is 'X' if the cell on the intersection of the the y-th row and x-th column is filled and \".\" if it is empty.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nq lines follow. Each line contains two integers x_1 and x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m), representing a query asking whether the subgrid of a containing the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output one line containing \"YES\" if the subgrid specified by the query is determinable and \"NO\" otherwise. The output is case insensitive (so \"yEs\" and \"No\" will also be accepted).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4 5\n..XXX\n...X.\n...X.\n...X.\n5\n1 3\n3 3\n4 5\n5 5\n1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nFor each query of the example, the corresponding subgrid is displayed twice below: first in its input format, then with each cell marked as \"E\" if it is exitable and \"N\" otherwise.\n\nFor the first query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..X EEN  \n    ... EEE  \n    ... EEE  \n    ... EEE  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the second query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    \n\nNote that you can exit the grid by going left from any leftmost cell (or up from any topmost cell); you do not need to reach the top left corner cell to exit the grid.\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the third query: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    \n\nThis subgrid cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable, because the below grid produces the above \"exitability grid\" as well: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fourth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fifth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..XXX EENNN  \n    ...X. EEENN  \n    ...X. EEENN  \n    ...X. EEENN  \n    \n\nThis query is simply the entire grid. It cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable because the below grid produces the above \"exitability grid\" as well: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..XXX  \n    ...XX  \n    ...XX  \n    ...XX  \n    \n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

The world you live in is a giant 10^9 \u00d7 10^9 grid, with squares having both coordinates between 1 and 10^9. \n\nYou know that the enemy base has the shape of a rectangle, with the sides parallel to the sides of the grid. The people of your world are extremely scared of being at the edge of the world, so you know that the base doesn't contain any of the squares on the edges of the grid (the x or y coordinate being 1 or 10^9). \n\nTo help you locate the base, you have been given a device that you can place in any square of the grid, and it will tell you the manhattan distance to the closest square of the base. The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a\u2212p|+|b\u2212q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy. Because of this, you need to make sure to never place the device inside the enemy base. \n\nUnfortunately, the device is powered by a battery and you can't recharge it. This means that you can use the device at most 40 times. \n\nInput\n\nThe input contains the answers to your queries. \n\nInteraction\n\nYour code is allowed to place the device on any square in the grid by writing \"? i j\" (1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 10^9). In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square (i,j) or -1 if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid. \n\nIf you recieve -1 instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than 40 queries. \n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \"! x y p q\" (1 \u2264 x \u2264 p\u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 q\u2264 10^9), where (x, y) is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest x and y coordinates, and (p, q) is the square inside the enemy base with the largest x and y coordinates. Note that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: \n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * See the documentation for other languages.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n? 2 2\n? 5 5\n? 4 7\n? 1 5\n! 2 3 4 5\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken.

The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not \u2261 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} .

Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same.

You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nYou are given an integer array a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j.

The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments.

The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.\n\nPlease implement a complete Python script.

{"id": "LeetCode/212", "prompt": "# Minimum Reverse Operations\n\nYou are given an integer `n` and an integer `p` in the range `[0, n - 1]`. Representing a **0-indexed** array `arr`\u00a0of length `n` where all positions are set to `0`'s, except position `p` which is set to `1`.\n\n\nYou are also given an integer array `banned` containing some positions from the array. For the **i****th** position in `banned`, `arr[banned[i]] = 0`, and `banned[i] != p`.\n\n\nYou can perform **multiple** operations on `arr`. In an operation, you can choose a **subarray** with size `k` and **reverse** the subarray. However, the `1` in `arr` should never go to any of the positions in `banned`. In other words, after each operation `arr[banned[i]]` **remains** `0`.\n\n\n*Return an array* `ans` *where* *for each* `i` *from* `[0, n - 1]`, `ans[i]` *is the **minimum** number of reverse operations needed to bring the* `1` *to position* `i` *in arr*, *or* `-1` *if it is impossible*.\n\n\n* A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.\n* The values of `ans[i]` are independent for all `i`'s.\n* The **reverse** of an array is an array containing the values in **reverse order**.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** n = 4, p = 0, banned = [1,2], k = 4\n**Output:** [0,-1,-1,1]\n**Explanation:** In this case k = 4 so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is 0. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1. Finally, with one reverse operation we can bring the 1 to index 3, so the answer for position 3 is 1. \n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** n = 5, p = 0, banned = [2,4], k = 3\n**Output:** [0,-1,-1,-1,-1]\n**Explanation:** In this case the 1 is initially at position 0, so the answer for that position is 0. We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray [0, 2] for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions -1. \n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** n = 4, p = 2, banned = [0,1,3], k = 1\n**Output:** [-1,-1,0,-1]\n**Explanation:** In this case we can only perform reverse operations of size 1.So the 1 never changes its position.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= n <= 105`\n* `0 <= p <= n - 1`\n* `0 <= banned.length <= n - 1`\n* `0 <= banned[i] <= n - 1`\n* `1 <= k <= n`\n* `banned[i] != p`\n* all values in `banned`\u00a0are **unique**\n\n\n\n\nPlease make sure your answer follows the type signature below:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minReverseOperations(self, n: int, p: int, banned: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n```\n", "scores": [{"name": "Yi-Coder-1.5B-Chat", "score": -4.157694877722863}, {"name": "Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct", "score": -4.4600519241116485}, {"name": "starcoder2-15b-instruct-v0.1", "score": -5.07327200794423}, {"name": "CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf", "score": -5.594904669470335}, {"name": "deepseek-coder-v2-lite-instruct", "score": -6.412015292634187}, {"name": "deepseek-coder-33b-instruct", "score": -6.504366014818312}, {"name": "Codestral-22B-v0.1", "score": -6.627551838386039}, {"name": "Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct", "score": -7.1162123093807175}], "rank": [0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7]}
