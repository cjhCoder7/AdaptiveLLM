You are given a connected undirected graph of n nodes with m edges. You also have q queries. Each query consists of two nodes a and b.\n\nInitially, all edges in the graph have a weight of 0. For each query, you must choose a simple path starting from a and ending at b. Then you add 1 to every edge along this path. Determine if it's possible, after processing all q queries, for all edges in this graph to have an even weight. If so, output the choice of paths for each query. \n\nIf it is not possible, determine the smallest number of extra queries you could add to make it possible. It can be shown that this number will not exceed 10^{18} under the given constraints.\n\nA simple path is defined as any path that does not visit a node more than once.\n\nAn edge is said to have an even weight if its value is divisible by 2.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5, n-1 \u2264 m \u2264 min{\\left((n(n-1))/(2), 3 \u22c5 10^5\\right)}).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n, x\u2260 y) indicating an undirected edge between node x and y.

The next line should then contain x spaced separated integers p_i indicating the path you take (p_1 = a, p_x = b and all numbers should fall between 1 and n).

{"id": "LeetCode/218", "prompt": "# Minimum Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal\n\nYou are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.\n\n\nYou are also given an integer array `queries` of size `m`. For the `ith` query, you want to make all of the elements of `nums` equal to `queries[i]`. You can perform the following operation on the array **any** number of times:\n\n\n* **Increase** or **decrease** an element of the array by `1`.\n\n\nReturn *an array* `answer` *of size* `m` *where* `answer[i]` *is the **minimum** number of operations to make all elements of* `nums` *equal to* `queries[i]`.\n\n\n**Note** that after each query the array is reset to its original state.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [3,1,6,8], queries = [1,5]\n**Output:** [14,10]\n**Explanation:** For the first query we can do the following operations:\n- Decrease nums[0] 2 times, so that nums = [1,1,6,8].\n- Decrease nums[2] 5 times, so that nums = [1,1,1,8].\n- Decrease nums[3] 7 times, so that nums = [1,1,1,1].\nSo the total number of operations for the first query is 2 + 5 + 7 = 14.\nFor the second query we can do the following operations:\n- Increase nums[0] 2 times, so that nums = [5,1,6,8].\n- Increase nums[1] 4 times, so that nums = [5,5,6,8].\n- Decrease nums[2] 1 time, so that nums = [5,5,5,8].\n- Decrease nums[3] 3 times, so that nums = [5,5,5,5].\nSo the total number of operations for the second query is 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 10.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [2,9,6,3], queries = [10]\n**Output:** [20]\n**Explanation:** We can increase each value in the array to 10. The total number of operations will be 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 20.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `n == nums.length`\n* `m == queries.length`\n* `1 <= n, m <= 105`\n* `1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 109`\n\n\n\n\nPlease make sure your answer follows the type signature below:\n\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n```\n", "scores": [{"name": "Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct", "score": 0.0}, {"name": "Codestral-22B-v0.1", "score": -2.1275616050939465}, {"name": "starcoder2-15b-instruct-v0.1", "score": -2.6399976631960627}, {"name": "deepseek-coder-v2-lite-instruct", "score": -3.5316559410980872}, {"name": "CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf", "score": -3.8851720417361064}, {"name": "Yi-Coder-1.5B-Chat", "score": -4.1050866587540025}, {"name": "Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct", "score": -4.166417131013752}, {"name": "deepseek-coder-33b-instruct", "score": -6.369702332961662}], "rank": [7, 5, 3, 4, 2, 0, 1, 6]}
